continuing from the kashmir post where comments were locked think there are some routes that can taken article 35a removal this very controversial article probably utmost importance least according what hear and read arbitrarily gives the state legislature powers that have place the kind democracy functioning india our democracy has been often criticized quasi federal federal with unitary bias because ours was experiment that had never even been conceived let alone tried anywhere the world land with multitudes language cultures and religions function democracy would either fall apart turn into autocracy the majority were the prevailing views 1947 there reason usa placed itself strategically closer pakistan hypothesized its homogeneity would help grow faster and remain stable india belied all their hopes the reason sheer ingenuity our constitution and inhuman capabilities our earlier leaders kashmir throughout remained out the loop due the very article question the example berlin before 1989 when east and west berlin existed eastern half was under communist regime ussr and the western under three nations usa and france the west was developed under open market economics while being financially helped the three nations east simultaneously remained stagnant and suffered akin the other balkan nations the easterners could see the west developing and wanted flee that side much that east germany government built the historic berlin wall could for starters remove the article 35a and allow free movement every sense accord with the constitution the kashmiris would want whats happening say mumbai bangalore than multan even bloody sinkiang region china thus exposure the wide world and idea what lies fully integrated himachal pradesh often the highest preforming state many indexes revered and often read immediate neighbor kashmir they won even have far and manage that who knows pok revolts join the mainstream kashmir just like the berlin wall fell 1989 must prove action time for theory crafting long past for investors shying away keynesian economics state where private investment dries public investment must step our government can spend 3600 cores statue with roi sight developing state the very breathing living people constitutionally bound serve will always find funds education due article 35a not many good schools could operate ratio the population demand the kashmiri pandit exodus drove away the majority educated populace this resulted young children aged attending madarsas for education when they graduated the age nearly years indoctrination resulted jilted attitude towards the nation large and extreme religious outlook the maulvis these madarsas often instilled separatist and jihadist thoughts inside these very impressionable brains also the lack exposure the rest the country meant these could not washed away when society taught something without external stimuli they become sounding boards for each other and and reinforce their self imposed thoughts painstakingly long process but probably the only one these are some the \ points could think right now but there are many many ways can bring them back internet the last remaining democracy let loose the jio adventure them when they see the lifestyle average mumbai bangalore citizen and compare with that any big pakistani city average citizen mind you they will know where secularism will lead and where religious indoctrination you can wish away disaster nor fight with weapons idea and very destructive idea has made home their brains what must slowly but surely,1

claims that the airstrike was botched hinges the authenticity and veracity the images released the pakistani armed forces shows two close shots parts supposedly from the payload and two other shots damaged terrain should noted that pictures damaged terrain did not contain the pictures parts supposedly from the payload thus given the history pakistani armed forces these pictures cannot taken conclusive evidence for geolocating the strike location,0

for people still doubting that paf used f16s ask yourself one question the paf didn use f16s and the iaf put out blatant lie why haven they come out and called out the iaf already wouldn beneficial pakistan and detrimental india they called out india maj gen ashif gharoor was quick respond with tweets about the air strikes and the capture our pilot where now its almost been entire day since the press conference pakistan has said nothing even though there are huge implications for them they use f16 this enough proof that f16 was indeed used yet some pakistanis are coming with bullshit evidence that strays further and further away from reality show that f16 wasn used,1

bit conflicted about the air strikes one hand iaf has not released any evidence yet the other highly doubt our armed forces would such grave steps violating the undisputed airspace another country without proper intel and drop bombs just trees and not hit anything saying this even after considering that modi might have pushed for remember the armed forces care lot about their reputation much that they didn cross the loc during the karfil war personally think that they waiting for pakistan respond yesterday press conference before releasing further info and evidence hopes catching pakistan another lie also maybe they didn want jeapardize the return abhinandan,1
don see how people are concluding that india has come out black faced and embarrassed don believe imran khan also don believe modi they politicians who lie don believe pakistan army they been caught lying all the time including yesterday but give one reason that indian armed forces have given you not believe them there evidence denying any claim made them india has showed the world that can retaliate cross border terrorism have repelled the cross border misadventure pakistan shooting down one jet theirs losing one ours process got one our pilots captured them this has been the only low point the captured pilot will released pakistan accepts they harbour maulana masood azhar now anyone who thinks that these two things happened because pakistan suddenly decided the right thing without crumbling international pressure definitely dumb pakistan has tried very hard show the world that they are peace lovers has worked indian public but were actually true why there continued diplomatic pressure from the international community them act undeniably the narrative being still held indians pakistan losing its face although leaking videos which themselves was violation international diplomatic conventions they are trying their best make success unfortunately working some the common people,1

think the key question that should talked about that why are using mig the first place and why didnt have response for amraam capability that pakistan has the argument that mig shot down despite being inferior plane argument for loosers they shot down our plane because they could doesnt matter why the political class needs answer that question and taken the cleaners for infuriating that one has asked this question the media yet,0

what were previous pms speaking think they all spoke hindi and media translates can speak gujarati too but doesn’ use outside gujarat this serious question there proposal you are speaker regional respectfully saying not trigger then you can look that language’ media and they will show translated clip whatever they are keen show not political conspiracy force hindi rest the nation even sonia gandhi speaking hindi may just that most population either understands uses dialect for national politics makes practical sense now pulling this all from memory admit that grew the north the country but eager hear there was speaking other indian language when speaking the masses,1
question from american here what are your official languages you not actually have any official languages like the mean the has official language the books but everything here english like memory serves there exactly one single road sign the whole the the united states that not english guess question what are your official languages the books what are your official languages,1
several reasons can think speaking english would reduce his audience even further only the economically well off would able follow him fluently can express himself more effectively hindi than english sounds bit comical english and very impressive hindi imo from the sangh parivar after all and they are pretty insistent using hindi the link language among indians this has always been problem india you think about people especially those the lower strata the society non hindi speaking areas get reports what was said national leaders hindi english from the vernacular media incidentally this also how people the hindi belt come know what leaders other regions say they get translated into english hindi other indian languages most middle and upper class people india wager are least somewhat functional hindi english even say that this less problem these days than was years ago,1
most the seats are the hindi belt another reason why one from south north east can ever become the foreseeable future,1
most comfortable hindi and gujarati and since hindi has the largest share speakers uses hindi,1
which also one the reasons why bjp can gain significant ground any the southern states coalitions with the regional parties the only way for them there,1
majority indian states people understand hindi and himself fluent that language and hence its easy address majority people most people watches bollywood right bollywood movies are made hindi for that reason only,1
about indians understand speak hindi its dialects while other language our country widely understood and has such wide reach possibly why hindi the language modi chooses speak,0
look get that india has massive hate boner for modi but you want criticize him criticize him the policy errors but don criticize meaningless areas does not speak non hindi languages well then let him speak hindi after all one the working languages india,0
though hindi speaker believe even dont understand what speaks most the time,1
you someone who doesn understand hindi understand your frustration and agree that lstv and rstv should probably something about translating the live proceedings possible but the same time you can question why man speaks the language which comfortable like asking kannadiga why are you speaking kannada when there are many non kannadigas india,1
naraimha rao didn’ speak hindi well used english mostly for his speeches you ignore urban english speaking population that represents about india rest can communicate only their respective native tongue hindi other local language they picked the amount diversity have ’ not simply possible find one language that can address entire nation think technology can used provide subtitles the recorded speech videos for live feed ’ difficult synchronize subtitles,1
what language should speak there are even fewer english speakers india than hindi speakers moreover probably more fluent hindi than english,1
because not everyone will understand english especially those who are not educated and plus speaking english makes him look belonging elite class which doesn connect with the common mass all pretty much every politician speaks hindi even raga does need stop finding conspiracy everything,1
want ask why the non hindi speakers the country don’ know learn hindi mean after all the national language,0
china japan russia all the middle eastern countries speak their language and the lang they are most comfortable they all know english,1
knows the non hindi speakers aren going vote for him down south anyway modi wouldn hurt mosquito sucking his blood unless helps him win elections,1

wtf your asking why the india speaking much hindi,0
the harsh truth hindi more less understood everywhere except south india north east and quite many can speak decent hindi english does not even stand chance when comes reaching masses,1
have this same question asked many friends but didn get satisfying answer,1
his english sucks and sound like moron hindi doesn make grammatical mistakes,0
every major politician speaks hindi because elections are won and bihar,1
people here really find strange reasons criticize him,1
probably since more comfortable least probably more than english and hindi has wider reach doesn’ bother ’ more comfortable tamil telugu compared hindi were making speech ’ probably find the language most comfortable because nuance matters statescraft ’ not too fazed the hindi speaking honest,1
probably because doesn know any other languages that more people can understand india,1
cos not very fluent english,0
hindi the language which very easy understand for the people who doesn know hindi but understand some the words,1
maybe cant communicate english explains why always smiling the photos and videos with other leaders,0

been closely following the news the claims the debunking claims etc and think that have theory what exactly happened the air engagement that let the indian pilot capture first all though you need bear mind that war government military including india and pakistan always speaks 100 truthfully for different reasons they actually believe that what they are saying correct the time that they said this especially true air air combat where every war history all sides claim have shot down more planes than were actually shot down air combat can confusing due the speeds and distances involved they are trying protect military operational secrets tell lies publically order maintain military secret good example this was the 1991 gulf war where the and saudi kept claiming that almost all the iraqi scud missiles were successfully intercepted patriot missiles order get iraq stop trying fire the missiles the reality was that the patriots only hit minority incoming missiles they know that don know the truth for sure but with whatever information they have that information helps with the morale their own fighting forces and civilians this why for example ww2 many pilots would get credit the kills they claimed even when solid proof was missing with that said what know about the aerial engagement pakistan said that indian planes chasing its retaliatory strike entered pakistani space initially pakistan claimed planes were shot down one pilot custody and one hospital pakistan later officially changed that one plane mig and one pilot india agreed that they chased the strike said immediately that they were chasing 16s and claimed have shot down one them pakistan denied using 16s the operation said was 17s india then days later claimed they had electronic signatures data indicating 16s were involved and then produced wreckage from amraam aim 120 missile saying that 16s are the only planes south asia than can fire that missile now lets look the actual evidence mig shot down solid proof photos and video the wreck and pilot evidence 2nd indian plane shot down evidence but pakistan officially stopped claiming this shot down evidence all the photo evidence india claimed has now been proven false third party experts 16s involved the aim 120 wreckage pretty damning initial claims that was sold taiwan have been denied taiwan and based experts have said that the overall sale package that include the missile covered both taiwan and pakistan the missile likely have been sold pakistan however the aim 120 long range missile over 100km mile range and not missile that pakistan would use close range encounter like the one that india claimed occured india said they fired heat seeking missiles which has 30km mile range the amraam very unlikely have been fired from the information saying that the could fire them very old from around 2008 and all recent information says that they only fire the chinese version the missile instead amraam could not fired from plane with chinese radar like the does missiles are compatible only with the radar systems they were built for how you reconcile all this theory which fits the available evidence below pakistan had plan retaliate dropping bombs indian kashmir mission profile 17s strike element crossing into indian airspace 16s were used long distance escort using long range aim 120 missiles from safely deep inside pakistani airspace 17s dropped bombs just before the indian migs were interception range they turned round and burned hard for pakistani space the mig 21s chased them hard and are faster than 17s almost catching them before hitting the border the indian wing commander made the call hot pursuit that brought them range fire missiles 17s used flares evade the missiles but since the missiles still detonated close enough the pakistani planes that looked like kill the indian pilots the from distance looks lot like and could visually confused more this later but the same time once the indians were pakistani space the 16s range fired least one amraam taking out mig either wreckage from that missiles was carried into india inertia more likely second amraam missed its target perhaps because the second mig was diving away while using countermeasures and ended india why pakistan initially though got planes kill and then one missile fired resulting the target rapidly losing altitude and why india thought got kill also explains why the amraam part ended india and explains why pakistani denied the use 16s not trying give away that they use long range amraam missiles cover the escape strike planes the indian plane that got away would have brought with electronic data showing that was getting painted the kind radar that the carries this together with the easy confuse misidentification the with would have led india convinced that they were only fighting 16s and not 17s like they actually were for the issue why pakistan initially claimed one pilot custody and one hospital that simple ispr the time had pieces information work into immediate press release the time pakistan claimed have shot down planes indian pilot was reported have been taken into custody indian pilot was hospital getting treated the time ispr had make statement was not clear them that the indian pilot taken into custody was then taken hospital and was thus the same pilot they reported hospital since they thought there were different indian pilots that fitted well with the claims they had the time planes being shot down,1

forgotten 190301213038382 html “when international media talks the history india pakistan antagonism fails recognise the fact that kashmiris have borne the brunt when indian media talks about terrorism fails mention the fact that kashmir one the most heavily militarised zones the world there was certain irony calls indian officials and public figures calling for pakistan uphold the geneva convention its treatment the captured indian pilot kashmir india has failed apply not just the geneva convention but much international law for that matter kashmiris are still being jailed political charges and used human shields while the united nations resolution which mandates referendum self determination conducted kashmir yet implemented the current anti war activism india limited small demonstrations and posts social media the elephant the room once again being ignored one talking about what true peace would actually entail dominant narratives propagated the indian state and the mainstream media are muffling kashmiri voices this moment important hear them speak and tell their stories war the killings torture enforced disappearances sexual violence mass blinding through the use pellet shotguns and everyday harassment kashmir cannot swept under the carpet and ignored this violence needs made visible because continuing escalating the current security policies the indian government will only result disaster ”,0
don’ know about paf doctrine and would surprised they ever make that public ’ just trying reason why and how pakistan would use long range missile all know that during engagement which india’ own admission was short ranged pakistan used expensive missile that underperforms close ranged engagements where missile maneuverability key the logical explanation that the plan that fired the missile was nowhere close its target especially doesn’ make sense because almost all photos where you see 16s almost any nation when they have long range amraams they are also carrying short ranged highly maneuverable sidewinder missiles too,1
makzimus and discussed huge conspiracy theory the kashmiri who blew pulwama how did get that much explosives how did know when and where suicide bomb the theory modi did all this with the help cia modi did the attack himself his army killing soldiers paid money jem claim the attack doing this linked the attack pakistan next question how did india get the location jem buildings balakot the answer cia jem funded saudis and saudis are bed with americans cia gave the location jem modi modi surgical strike didn hit target what the main war going the world america china economical war inevitable china will become the next super power with way things are going who going hold their status for them pakistan providing cheap labor for china when they will majority only produce skilled workers what america gains doing this instability pakistan they are trying stop the process china being super power what modi gains this wins election and earns trust current superpower america just theory,1

return the iaf pilot the pak government was great move although some opposed saying they should have demanded release col habib and other prisoners and but was better escalate the situation returning the pilot now here confusion feb ispr claimed was captured pak army the way safety someone the video was shouting look for the other pilot maybe was close loc the other pilot could have landed and escaped cuz now the other pilot missing iaf has not confirmed like they did for abhi but did confirm the downed jets thoughts have strong feeling pak having the other pilot but maybe wrong here time will tell ispr will but they already did edit there were intelligence officers when they captured the pilot you never know since they are involved,1

serious question was there really second plane shot down that crashed iok and was su30 did our lovely jf17 take out 88hjcdg ohk and also asking coz really need clear this there are many news articles online saying indian fighter jets were shot down but mention which ones,1
seeking clarifications the claims that the pakistani military can fuel jets for more than weeks this true just more indian propaganda and true what then nuclear surrender what,1
good job the posting same goddamn articles was becoming nauseating maybe have separate thread for india folks who want bring the same conspiracy theories and title something that makes them think are actually listening,1
can any one confirm that the first plane the second def seems clear dnt not lose any that day might even have bought down mki word,1
this true,1
just theory but think indian jets were hit one being and other being mig one video locals said they saw parachutes and ispr initially stated they caught with one other soldier drifting iok the may have hit f16 which may have been used defensively intercept them but not used offensively for crossing loc part mission that why india have that missile amraam 120 also fell indian side now india doesn want accept that lost they initially denied the existence their pilots and then revised only one pilot mia pakistan army used that statement their own favor and revised the count only one pilot being captured the mig guy abhinandan and using him peace gesture while having 2nd guy for interrogation this gave india the chance claim that the mig brought down f16 change narrative from not hitting the target pakistan using f16 offensively edit parachutes being one from our f16 pilot while other being indian and another 4th one who landed indian side which local might have missed maybe f16 was never shot down and all parachutes were indian soldiers,0

rss good but their other parts like vhp and bajrang dal are bad and yeah vhp and bajrang dal should banned for harrassing minorities,0
modiji specifically didn get hands dirty doing all that this time like did avenge the uri attacks probably just aligned with the iaf army suggestions,0
yes but they are strong politically important states can anything against them,1
they organisation under their affiliation are involved bomb attacks train bus majid they have been involved riots they are openly giving hate speeches etc they are terrorist organisation pakistan has jaish india has rss they are involved different level terrorism but terrorism nevertheless,0
grandfather worked for the rss during early days the very decade india got independence and gandhi was assassination passed away years back used tell stories about his time the rss and pretty much agreed with being terrorist organisation according him the only thing stopping the rss the constitution india which vastly different from those islamic countries organisations like vhp abvp bajrang dal etc are organisations run the rss members they the dirty work for the rss including but not limited lynching the name cow harassment unmarried couples and riots the rss being the parent bjp national party wouldn like name attached all the dirty work they sanathan sanstha most definitely terrorist organisation chidambaram former home minister upa once declined declare terrorist organisation 67nsqrsoa6eslb299fnmvk html,0
extremist organisation for sure don know can call them terrorist group yet,1
that being said now parents consider antinational and are telling leave the bad company tell them your company where you work college that feeding you all this and hence you would like resign drop out and join the parivar desh seva,0
that being said now parents consider antinational and are telling leave the bad company beta hit the unsubscribe button india jokes aside rss operates like state sponsored terrorist organization one can touch them because they have sympathy from right wing public,0
about being anti national you should tell many people possible that rss didn support the indian national flag didn support the indian constitution after independence they only accepted after they were banned history shows how patriotic the rss really throughout india freedom struggle the rss was subservient the british with its leadership prohibiting participation mass movements hindutva nationalism rss etho religious cultural extremist group many the heir members are implicated violence but rss not literally terrorist group today you look objective analysis what typically constitutes working terrorist groups bajrang dal could qualify terrorist group although these would equivalent mafia drug cartel violent groups sanathan sanstha though most likely terrorist group,1
they are the textbook definition terror group look the wiki definition terrorism the unlawful use violence and intimidation especially against civilians the pursuit political aims does the rss fit under this category let see consider then that this the most powerful non state outfit india with real opposition besides the police theory consider then that pursuit their aims the group has spawned multiple sub groups which are far more violent than they are their student wing the abvp has strong history intimidation the bajrang dal are notorious the vhp even more together talking about millions members qaeda its peak has some 000 today given their size reach and degree cultural intimidation they genuinely strike terror across india the last years people have started getting afraid voicing themselves saying certain things doing certain things certain days day supporting certain parties public sure the right will disagree and come with reasons why rss isn close something like jem that why sticking the idea terror itself boils down one fundamental difference indians are not afraid islamic terrorists are more prone rise against them than cower from them mumbai went back work the very next day after general indian people feel collective sense fuck you terror groups that instills sense collective confidence but indian people are afraid the rss and its families affected the way speak live think and make friends especially the last few years has found out how tough even maintain familiy bonds when discussing this topic see altogether how many friends have been lost uncles ignored and even fathers and mothers distanced from because how divisive the air has become the rss and its families make far more afraid people than all the islamic terrorists ever have through effective political mobilization and through ensuring they don get arrested for terror terror tricks fate they enjoy what islamic terrorists don enjoy success influence and power knowledge though would say that people mix the rss and the other groups that come under the sangh parivar tough say who more violent than the others but names like the vhp hindu mahasabha bajrang dal are key players note this distinction the rss ideological hub but may not the one directly coordinating acts terrorizing india maybe that title could the abvp lynching family demands 691783 html who create climates fear and intimidation every university they are the vhp who are most prominent valentine day less this year though the bajrang dal hindu mahasabha this group actively massacred muslims front gandhi during the partition riots difficult say who worse than the other and not sure myself you might find that the rss link more causal than direct many attacks indian citizens view they well all their supporters are guilty creating climate terror,1
they are right wingers but not qualify terrorist group even the doesn qualify dedicated hardcore rss member compared nitin gadkari,1
they fund all the chillar sanghi groups that inevitably cause hate crimes around the country,0
ndtv the next day reeeeee mudi meks fun dyslexic people reeee mudi shud rejine,1
not really terrorist group but they are kind terrorist group social sphere india their motive only establish society hindus which consist upper echelon not really for all hindus for which they blow their trumpet they want india become what was before the british came the called bharat with great social difference,1
per oxford dictionary terrorism the unlawful use violence and intimidation especially against civilians the pursuit political aims samjhauta express blast malegaon blasts gujarat massacre ajmer dargah and mecca masjid blast murder gauri lankesh and more recently they were about blow the pune sunburn fest rss the umbrella organisation for bhagwa groups like bajrang dal sanatan sanstha etc whose members were accused these cases now supporting terrorism and harbouring terrorists terrorism guess makes rss one such group like pakistan all the accused were aquited all the cases guess happens india,1
they helped hari singh conduct genocide kashmiri muslims killed between 000 100 000 men women and children right before signed over kashmir since then they functioned the same way that the white citizens councils the did the wcc would use the kkk conduct lynchings and terrorist attacks against minorities keeping themselves insulated from legal action here the rss uses the vhp bajrang dal etc conduct physical violence that they can escape legal action,1
you need the views hedgewar golwalkar non hindus figure out what rss all about concede that they social work too but does hamas muslim brotherhood etc too,1
was caught similar debate ‘saffron terror’ and sympathizer the group said ‘ what rss has never instigated been involved any incident outside india ’  yes they are right wing and nationalist organization that have taken the responsibility protecting faith however personally ’ rather have arya samaj chinmaya mission promote and preserve faith rather than radical order provide muscle and giving fascist tone their propaganda you’ stir hornet’ nest each time you link rss with the word ‘terror’ incidents history have given reason and left sour taste the mind peaceful hindus rss have been involved abetting riots and vigilantism many occasion they have narrowly missed being classified ‘terrorist’ outfit,1
vhp for sure cant saay the same for rss,1
your parents are right stop using reddit read more right wing propaganda whatsapp and facebook that should help you,1
talk less smile more,1
nope they far right group vhp bajrand dal etc worse,0
irrespective anyone view rss making claim and then looking for ways prove what makes indian media and social media unbearable please responsible and ask for information first then make relevant claims not the other way around,1
not terrorist organization imo but groups surrounding them such bajrang dal vhp are fucking terrorist they are isi india,0
imho anyone thing that teaches you hate another person religion caste nation etc should classified terrorist group,0
you can call rss terrorist group but that doesn mean rss equivalent qaeda let jem isis etc most people call rss terrorist group equate them with groups like which immediately comes mind when you hear terrorism this categorically false and very harmful political discourse the long run what you are actually doing here expanding the range what public perception considers terrorism using certain buzzwords this way how end with words losing their entire meaning like when anything right center fascism nazism and anything left center marxism communism,1
person who has seen rss work close can safely say that they are terrorist organisation little story hail from uttarakhand which was hit deadly rains and cloud bursts 2013 the flash floods were bad many small children lost their parents guardians caretakers rss went there are brought orphaned children into their offices where these kids live rss also pays for their education know this because the rss guys are neighbhbors and the complex which the children are housed located beside house now all know how gunda rss can but they also lot positive work towards the society rss sewaks had great hand cleaning and restoring the areas affected floods state imo their pros outweigh their cons,1
the supreme court india prevention act specified the following definition terrorism whoever with intent overawe the government law established strike terror the people any section the people alienate any section the people adversely affect the harmony amongst different sections the people does any act thing using bombs dynamite other explosive substances inflammable substances lethal weapons poisons noxious gases other chemicals any other substances whether biological otherwise hazardous nature such manner cause likely cause death injuries any person persons loss damage destruction property disruption any supplies services essential the life the community detains any person and threatens kill injure such person order compel the government any other person abstain from doing any act commits terrorist act source wikipedia now you can decide yourself qualifies for being called terrorist organisation not you ask for opinion confused looking into this definition written the most complicated way guess you should ask this law student lmao,1
god people referring rss not terrorist organizations are getting downvoted hell calm yourself down people they just stating their opinion,1
grandfather was staunch rss guy with his and his old ass friends khaki shorts ending dangerously away from his knees during partition was the rss who were there provide food and medical attention hindu while the sikhs were way better prepared and had their own system take care sikh refugees from pakistan the hindu refugees found ready organisation with branches everywhere which was instrumental improving their standard living along with reservations colleges and government jobs grandparents and their generation were saved lot struggle and had their kids survive because the initial support they received from the rss network another note just like the refugees nepalese also before 2000 had mostly friends family and the rss depend when they first came india they have done some great work and continue and and will one their core responsibilities however they definitely support certain offshoot organisations through which they get their dirty work done smart organisation having survived the worst times the country has gone through and assume them smart enough not directly involved crap that could get them banned,1
like with good sense humor,1
our gracious prophet mudiji pbuh not only serious and hardworking but also bakchod,0
terrorist just overused general word feel nowadays any act violence termed terrorism including violence state forces nonetheless answer your question based perception rss has hardline stance certain issues and they probably want impose this indian public through politics bjp litigation propaganda through media and conferences the garb social service and publications they are certainly one those groups that impose their ideology you and not educate you true sense long they are law abiding and legal they cannot termed terrorists although some people affiliated with rss have taken law unto themselves silence those who oppose them cannot termed terrorist organisation because institution that directly doesn condone terror terrorist organisation one that does this from top bottom personal belief rss top brass doesn necessarily imply endorse this stance though certain members are possibly culpable that makes difficult classify them terrorists when you compare them with generally accepted terror groups that have been classified terrorists like qaeda ltte etc,1
not terrorist group per but the style splc classification they would classified certainly some sort hate supremacist group but the problem with rss isn that was the same problem with gandhi family during upa imo they are bunch unelected extraconstitutional figures who wield enormous influence elected government policies and actions which should not happen democracy,0
course they are you can tell your parents you really want that painting and dismissing alternate points view antinational the real antinational,1
yep rss bajrang dal vhs sanatan sansthan the whole bunch actually,1
opinion rss hindu version muslim brotherhood technically never linked terrorism but people with common sense knows what they are doing muslim brotherhood not terrorist organization except per middle east countries russia but you talk with member you will get the hatred they posses same goes with rss,0
terrorism the unlawful use violence and intimidation especially against civilians the pursuit political aims they definitely fit this group,1
the best part was everyone understood god raga national joke,1
verry much,1
yes even though rss isn your conventional terrorist organisation most parties india should not even allowed exist congress being threat democracy since independence dismissing state governments because they don fit their ideology kerala punjab killing agitators who were demanding creation maharashtra emergency and then the sikh genocide rigging elections bjp rss and their ilk have instigated riots 2002 ayodhya and created division across the country cpi and tmc with their constant political killings dont even want into regional parties from bihar these organisation should not allowed function politically socially,1

like how all these opposition leaders and their fans brag about how modi been exposed voters will punish him etc and then rush make last minute alliances with one another admitting that fact they believe the bjp still has more voters than their parties they probably sweep delhi but this the end aap anything more than another small compromised regional party and definitely the end alternative politics india for another generation kejriwal particular has accepted that will never anything more than delhi and perhaps not even that the near future,1

read most the comments here and feel like each one them has taken clue from what comes news and print media been rss branch and the reality far from you had done just basic research mean actual research not one two media articles you read you won have posted this question,1
that loaded question and the answers you get will depend purely the political leanings the one answering rather than factual basis,1
stating that rss also should come under the classification terrorist organizations but don know rss should classified terrorist group what are your views this don want comment whether rss terrorist organization not but what you are doing the classic case confirmation bias you have first made your mind about issue and afterwards are looking for proofs which suits your narrative,1

credited the airstrikes with destroying the illusion that nuclear deterrence can keep india from hitting terrorist infrastructure inside pakistan but modi’ plan didn’ intended independent reporting showed that the indian jets had hit some trees field — and not much else the next morning pakistani fighter jets dropped some bombs inside indian controlled territory which did damage restored

some cases may not untouchability where used live earlier school days large part the labor were heavy smokers paan chewers etc incidence also was very high talking about east area due small children the house the utensils were separate that said the cook was lady from the called untouchable classes and she used eat and drink the same utensils,0
few people here are commenting that matter preference and yes having separate set utensils can matter preference but the big question here think the why you have fancy set utensils that you use when guests come over can described preference because the why this question would that you don want use fancy plate for your everyday eating and have sometime special for guests but when you keep separate set utensils for your workers maids domestic helps etc can not described preference because the why that question would the underlying belief that they are somehow lower than does anyone here disagree that the reason behind keeping separate plate something different than this someone has also mentioned that they might not comfortable sharing the same utensils fair enough your utensils but tell why you are not comfortable when you say that someone can not sit the same level chair that you and must sit the floor not matter preference when you say that you won eat with certain person that can not matter preference again one can and should able force you eat together with someone that why say the why important you simply don like that person not eating together won shouldn big deal however you won eat together with that person because she belongs different caste that discrimination have not mentioned any caste political party here also not claiming whether not the political party question actually exercises those discriminatory behaviour also not saying anything whether their rival party isn guilty the said behaviour response those people who are dismissing this non issue,1
all the people saying have personal stuff just want say its cool with your family having your own preferred utensils and undergarments and stuff maybe you like that little garfield coffee mug you purchased trip and want keep for your personal use has personal value problem with that but why don you people use that fancy cutlery and utensils for your maid which you have reserved for your guests those utensils are not designated certain person family person your house doesn have any personal attachment anyone your household why not give them for use you with random general guests the very fact that you have cheap alternate utensils for maid use signifies your elitist mindset you won give your maid superior even equal value utensils because they are lower stature your mindset that hard truth resulting out thousands years our beliefs not entirely your fault but the fault our environment and society,1

air strikes shouldnt politicised amid india pakistan hostilities national interest needs take precedence 6189631 html balakot air strikes shouldn politicised amid india pakistan hostilities national interest needs precedence india pakistan hostilities need delicate handling and adding political colour the sensitive situation not what the country needs right now this precisely what families soldiers have been reminding the public amid the warmongering that followed the pulwama terror attack easy sit behind phone desktop and cry destroy pakistan and point fingers the administration but this war are talking about the need the hour for both the ruling party and the opposition introspect and set aside their selfish motives national interest careful thought and diplomacy need pave the forward not political blame game,0
indeed humiliating enough that third rate failed state managed capture indian pilot and then come out looking like the bigger more magnanimous power releasing him but added that the indian government got caught lying and making shit all our pilots are accounted for and most indian media got caught amplifying them unskeptically this whole thing has been such embarrassment for supposed wannabe world power which ostensibly set out avenge terrorist attack,1
friends are sayings washington fake some saying paid congress some are saying anti modi,0
not exactly right indian media has been shitty for many years even during congress era was the same all started with the advent arnab goswami implemented the fox model steroids once others started noticing their ratings fall they started doing the same iirc didn ndtv and barkha dutt announce the location our special forces live air during our media has been shitty trp whores for long long time,1
pulwama attack cannot justified any reasoning whatsoever the people who killed our soldiers should brought justice sad part that the whole incident highlighted how much the bjp trying gain from anti pakisthan sentiment congress also opportunist congress another idiot that cannot anything because they have power left they lost credibility they looted the country for years used think pak media much propaganda driven and encashing general hatred towards india but now see difference between our and their media our soft corner for our brave soldiers has been missused for ages but the picture clear political parties have been using generalised hatred against each other tool and nothing else this has been going for ages and will continue sad see any rational question against bjp claim regarding the strike becomes antinational being leftist etc etc saw news channels asking users not spread abhinandan video because another trick pakistan think because people would praise pak army for being nice,1

from what heard from sources few days back definitely shot down two planes one their pilots got arrested almost immediately and was subsequently shown proof abhinand hadn been shown then india would have said there causality was also told that the helicopter crash india was not crash but was shot down well but not too certain about that basically everyone usa israel india scratching their heads right now said india can retaliate after pulwama giving india the guts strike although think did not anticipate this but india did cross loc with aircraft which was far bigger blunder than intelligence failure that caused pulwama the first place that automatically means pakistan could also strike back especially imran specifically said will retaliate before all this now india had struck our f16 surely would have been photographed now instead are still chasing this second aircraft just don want this become another thing disagree upon pakistan should wait for things settle down tensions are still very high among the ranks and later should reveal full details letting the public speculate about for too long will only cause more harm than good,1

washington post after pulwama the indian media proves the bjp’ propaganda machine noredirect utm source reddit com utm term bb3fa6258d98 our investigation into the indian media’ reporting the pulwama attack found that many reports were contradictory biased incendiary and uncorroborated news organizations such india today ndtv news the indian express first post mumbai mirror ani and others routinely attributed their information anonymous “government sources ” “forensic experts ” “police officers” and “intelligence officers ” independent investigations were conducted and serious questions about intelligence failures were left unanswered once eliminated the spectacle realized that the indian public got very little information about the pulwama attack and its aftermath beyond the confusion over the death tolls balakot news organizations variously reported that between and 350 kilograms the explosive rdx was used the attack when such information was officially released reports also identified different people the supposed masterminds the pulwama attack various points without clear sourcing more than two weeks after the attack our analysis finds that news site had rectified the errors their reporting leaving these misleading facts matter public record,1

agree that media should way more nuanced its reporting kashmir however the article itself quite biased against india the reporter says that the media has legitimised hindutva treating indian media monolithic entity when anything but large section openly criticised the move and continues reporting kashmir too war like situation bound push back lesser concerns like rafale not evidence that media bjp propaganda machine journalistic standards definitely need higher but most the indian media going report things from the indian perspective rather than the pakistani perspective obvious that the things that give higher trp are going over reported natural that indian media will give more credence indian claims than pakistani these circumstances the end the day most the mainstream news channels care only about trp realise this one only has watch debate any news channel fucking joke indian media needs introspect and raise its journalistic standards and provide more credible sources for their claims however claiming the entire indian media bjp propaganda machine simplistic and erroneous assertion painting all indian media with this broad brush the reporter trying discredit any its stories the future polis great organisation however evidenced from this article and all the others posted their own website they have their own agenda regarding kashmir ironic that she asserts that the indian media should have more nuanced approach towards kashmir which strongly agree with and then takes such simplistic view towards the entirety indian media further her organisation agenda,1

was congress very late the social media game since 2014 bjp currently enjoys enormous dominance over social media narrative right now this changing how are you trying change how you plan combat the religious far right narrative social media bjp social media driven mostly either relgious far right hatred modi personality beyond social media how you plan combat hate politics rahul gandhi image has been painted succesfully bjp enormously negative and incompetent even not based reality how are you guys managing combat that for example rahul made many speeches many think tanks those speeches are not spread lot the social media team like this one found this chance when was searching for specific speeches and topics this hasn been publicized lot nationalism you think congress leaders should talk agressively pakistani deep state sponsorship terror know the views manish tewari surjewala because searched the statements their leaders but problem visibility this should repeated again and again their statements are not getting enough limelight nationalism rahul gandhi has indeed praised the iaf strikes and others which the positive step but after that the fog war bjp makes unsubtantiated statement 400 dead random congress leaders questions bjp brands you anti national equating questioning this questioning the indian air force bjp indeed dangerously politicizing the airstrikes but congress falling into the trap taking their bait seems congress falling into the bait bjp most common people not really care about minute details spice 2000 spice 250 most people don care the narrative what congress losing domestic politics international media doesn fight elections here what you think omar abdullah advice the opposition the more you talk about economy and jobs less you have talk about anti national national the opposition parties need switch tracks deny the the space politicise the recent terror attack air strikes the way keep the messaging focused the economy rural distress unemployment agriculture all the other things bjp doesn’ want discussed every time talk about pulwama balakote leave the door wide open for the the bjp play their strengths front their home audience logic would dictate switch strategies make them play our strengths now here another article omar retweeted which says modi has failed many issues but winning the narrative falling into every trap modi setting for them 2004013 some food for thought what you think the ideal way approach this congress willing shift tracks omar put the mahagatbandhan what congress strategy creating narrative for the party the opposition here seems bjp tying more alliances from shiv sena aiadmk for simply boils down two things either there prepoll alliance there not there will come under upa there not then possible that there will post poll alliance then why the need campaign together and the same stage you don put common candidate from each constituency the opposition mega rallies seem only benefit non congress parties the called mahaghatbandan the grand alliance really that much different from nda upa can congress clarify approach alliances modi creating simply narrative you are with you are with khichdi what congress simple message 2014 and rethinking rahul gandhi had said that congress leaders had gotten arrogant the end years upa which was one cause the downfall congress how does the congress message look back upa you say openly you made mistakes but the party has moved improved itself introspected the faults have you thought new name for alliance you win like replacement upa mark symbolic new beginning twitter there lot hate speech and fake news twitter bjp parlimaentary leaders summoned jack dorsey after twitter india suspended hate speech peddler squintneon abvp member from assam who posted posts mocking and celebrating the death dalit student rohith vermula his account was then promoted smiti irani twitter panelists are invited will congress able highlight the core cause this twitter hoopla bigot from abvp mocking suicide and being supported smiriti irani congress should publicize this direct support for this man parliament should also ask about twitter handling rampant fake news and hate speech twitter bjp again created the narrative jack dorsey snubs india based this one temperoriliy deletion hate speech supporter congress should highlight this incident bjp trying appropriate ambedkar and talk dailt rights but leaders are supporting such hatemongerers but twitter narrative jack dorsey who personally doesn know much sweeping this under the rug that know very long questions but these are important topics and congress would benefit from this discussion takes the right lessons,1

lol please tag humor,1
were even the best would probably the same the media known twist statements and youtube trending page symbol for that but that reason not hold press conference and holding press conference wouldn really change thing because you name any disaster this government has done and the ministers have list reasons which they collectively share justify the reasons are stupid and veto you are doubting the army you are spreading pakistan agenda followed diverting the whole question into the nationalism the asker this trend has been followed the lord himself his election rallies and has been upheld roast pun intended liberals and journalists while doing such scenario even journalists except maybe ravish would think twice before asking question all all can only hope that things don get worse that they will affect our daily lives minority the people even considering criticizing the government taking rally speeches with pinch salt that case democracy has left the chat already and this every dictator wet dream,1

this something that always keep thinking about and when see the frequent press conferences the and other ministers state keep holding and taking questions from the press always have the same question what the hell the doing without holding any press conferences dictatorship better than this you know because that case atleast everyone knows indeed dictatorship but here hidden hidden behind jumlas like the media anti national opinion anyone who holds public offices cannot take questions from the media not worthy that office all but then again need also think about this cannot handle press conference doesn really know answers large proportion the questions that will asked any group people chosen random from those posting comments here sure about that forget about journalists good ones cannot even answer questions from layman,1

they have solid vote bank which votes them blindly whatever happens obviously they feel they will always reckoning not forget our msm which kept pappu pedestal for long,0
several congressis exist who blindly vote for the gandhis these people are either self proclaimed called intellectuals either people bribed them for loan waiver liquor they liked the old more corrupt system,1
why vote for congress thinking aloud wearing congressi hat changes are visible under years modi however wrong imply that chages happened under congress imho the most visible changes the shortest time happened india during upa when salaries shot jobs were plenty real estate and stock markets did well and people became richer agri commodity prices shot and farmers had good time after long time and not seen since many large infra projects were started now most was because global boom but still was during upa1 also upa1 can replicated becaue global conditions and pappu but theoretically visible changes did happen modi main contribution structural changes followed visible changes you are muslim you have enough reasons vote for modi most reasons are based out wrongly placed fear but some are genuine well there large class people who have benefited from congress system the elites not just delhi but every town and villages there would people who would have gotten money and power because being aligned woth congress babus businessman and journalists foreign education for kids jobs ngo funding contracts etc now under bjp the people who are will benefit will dofferent from above let not pretend that bjp the local level operates like modi the congress beneficiaries have valid reason vote congress while bjp beneficiaries would want bjp caste equations belief that congress will make true promises loan waiver income gurantee reality they would small extent,1
personally don see any difference between congress and bjp rule also given chance bjp for many years what made you think that should give chance modi think modi became because bjp has vote bank and strong national presence combined with anti incumbency year congress rule now rahul gandhi also betting same thing let bjp win many times they can after that congress the default choice maybe people will like see new face who didn rule until now don know when politics india will charge most people may not like comment because elections are almost here and everyone probably decided congress bjp they just opportunistic arrogant leaders who won any good unless they are forced for votes and seats,1

politicians have press conferences gain visibility and make themselves popular answering questions and disseminating information are secondary and the media gets trps return press conferences the serve real purpose that official documents and press briefings ministers and bureaucrats cannot serve not having press conferences given modi doesn mean that there slide towards dictatorship this just reflects the fact that traditional media doesn play big role used and gets elected just reinforce that,1
really nice points raised this post not congress supporter but too extremely disappointed this still remember how the bjp made fun munmohan singh for being quite but whatever this guy says the public scripted the hilt think absolutely pathetic for all the chest beating and inch chest whatever,0

please call your isp see what they say first urge them fix this the more people that complain directly the better for rather than complain reddit complain your isp call since doubt they will reply emails,1
please rebel your government shit,0
think the saddest part india two party country and such stupid policies will made other parties too can and probably should vote out bjp but what cost congress led alliance will maybe take some populist methods early get approval from the people but will still led leaders who care firstly about themselves next for their family and friends and never about the country its people what the solution more politically active india the cusp great intellectual revolution can make all the jokes about superpower 2020 thing but are going superpower very soon the youth the country very powerful thing high time take more active role how our country governed,1
wait reddit really your government that retarded,0
how take action against this next election don vote for bjp change org petition whatever takes,1

replace modi with any party and this shall stand true although intensity may differ but now that modi has set the bar jingoism everyone shall try beat that jai hind,1
that good description one thing though shouldn there another light for the shadow behind him just saying,1
like see the videos ravish blasting the congress with the same effort that puts for the bjp have expected these videos part your post the first place educated people say that anti bjp because that exactly the thing seems have been doing these last years for all the ranting that happening the media for one happy acknowledge that the last years have been relatively peaceful the country have not had any large communal flare there have been small incidents but they have been quelled pretty quickly,1
when people have too many options choose from they will always fall into their eco chambers that’ how human psyche works all see happening around people from same language state country banding together nobody wants feel uncomfortable any pov against own makes uncomfortable resist and sometimes retaliate against media here make money they will pander people they want target most the media has taken the extremes issues they think they can milk ndtv and ravish target the people who are moderates moderates love the eco chamber ndtv bjp modi nationalist hindutva etc have plenty eco chambers congress rahul tmc etc got their own everyone has the freedom chose their news source and freedom criticize others the problem none are ready listen and think anything outside their comfort zone this problem with all humans irrespective the country you are,1
that really depends how one perceives journalists and their duty ideally the field demands neutrality not neutral journalist has very visible set thoughts opinions ideology his own neutrality not limited not favoring particular party alone also means that you yourself shouldn lean towards ideology left the centre journalist which makes little more critical bjp compared congress that doesn necessarily makes him bad journalist but can safely say far from being the best one that being said think one can find better journalists print media the constraints maintaining viewership really hampers the way you can conduct news and its contents,1
people did not realise that always been critical and edgy doesn matter who the power one the best journalist have seen ages,1

for instance prime minister narendra modi suddenly short circuited the 126 fighter negotiation with dassault and announced the fighter deal without his own defence minister knowing about the time this lie has been repeated again and again but that won make true the original mmrca had several issues including but not limited dassault not agreeing provide warranty for jets made hal and hal man hours requirement making eurofighter bid the cheapest instead dassault from the cag report for the calculation the cost production the aircraft india hal under tot the rfp required the vendors quote the man hours required for production india eads quoted man hour requirement million man hours while quoted million man hours but its bid had stated that these man hours were according the french industry this was not accordance with the rfp which required the vendor quote the man hours required india the time bench marking june 2011 hal had stated that the french man hours had converted indian man hours multiplying das quoted man hours factor but cnc ignored this factor while determining the benchmark price well the vendor this created difficulties later during negotiations with when the cnc realized that after applying the factor the manpower cost was longer the vendor the rfp also stated that the vendor shall guaranty the performance the product design specification the production agency customer locations during cnc took the position that the firm was only responsible for delivery direct flyway aircraft ckd skd and kits and weapons and associated supply and services hal the production agency was responsible for the quality the 108 aircraft manufactured under tot cnc insisted that should take full responsibility for the quality and performance all 126 aircraft required under the rfp the congress likes quote 2014 agreement between hal and dassault portray that this issue was resolved but the disagreement was between contract negotiation committee ministry defence and dassault not hal and dassault the cag report also demolishes that false claim the above two issues led stalemate negotiations five years after the bid and after three years evaluation and negotiations there was finalisation,1

paging realityf wrote detailed explanation another thread,1
well according bhakths anyone who doesnt subscribe their far right ideology commie,1
left wing and right wing are terms coined during the french revolution fundamentally what left means the political ideology social equality opposed the social hierarchy which the right wing ideology the term came about because the seating arrangement french parliament which the left side opposed the monarchy and the right side was occupied the monarchy and its supporters people are partly right saying that congress left center because fundamentally opposed social hierarchy but not the extent that ultra leftist and this was inherent during the freedom movement the people who call congress left are not the pseudo intellectuals there merit calling them that anyone who says left means communism nothing more than idiot maoism marxism leninism are all different variations left ideologies with varying degrees also just because someone says they are left doesn mean they are against capitalism for example left but support capitalism with regulation the words don mean anything different and should not mean anything different the indian context well anyone thinks that they are the pseudo intellectuals,1
leftists are those who are concerned with communism and equality generally they demand for change societies and they are generally liberals cpi extreme left leftists not support capitalistic ideologies,0
well many people use these words differently you right the traditional left used refer the self named communist parties even the west you have centre left and more left wing parties although you don have too many communist parties congress centrist centre left party india unique country and the trends will not exactly equal but you could find some similarities with different parties parties make have some leftist policies and some rightwing policies terms economics terms economics very mixed bag you have different different specific policies and implementation that each party cpm has minimal presence india today they used dominant three states tripura kerala and west bengal now they are power only one kerala with bleak prospects ever winning any other state communist parties are called communist but their actual policies vary and depend the state and the leader all three communist ruled states had different policies,1
don know much about politics and all but when hear left party associate with the communist party their alliances but curious after reading this post searched about and found that party called left the party which strives hard for the betterment the masses and the down trodden and the party which does not compromise with its basic tenets like establishment egalitarian society and whose cadre are ready sacrifice their lives for that noble cause establish heaven the earth the class less society through democratic means this definition may change from person because different people have different opinions,1

your occupation promotes others delight sensory gratification there text called the sutta the bamboo acrobat talaputa sutta which discusses performance arts nowhere else stated this wrong livelihood but the buddha does make clear that anyone believes their destination heavenly realm for such occupation then their destination actually hell some have interpreted this suggest performance art general wrong livelihood but that never been specified elsewhere only that performance artists are aware that the work unskillful that recognition mindful what you are stimulating others should enough mitigate the worst the karma when conditions are more suitable for you would ideal move into more wholesome line work until conditions are better for though simply mindful and cultivate your practice the best your ability given the conditions you have been dealt,1

not sex worker but have been client sex workers though not cam models and have thought about this bit here how see monastics take vow celibacy not and you are not member the monastic sangha you are layperson the precept take vow avoid sexual misconduct which rather vague term what does that entail for think simple not engage something where any the participants have not meaningfully consented are being harmed your job certainly doesn sound like that the contrary you say lucrative and even enjoyable and works well around your mental and emotional states also say from the point view client that sex workers have helped grow person many ways can much more meaningful and compassionate work than think many people realise would say that the only uneasiness for knowing that very few sanghas are going share this view has made wonder sometimes whether can still call myself buddhist religious sense,1

brave maybe stupid lol brave and maybe stupid link modi trump brave and maybe stupid roast people for disabling comments insta because neflix does that all the time when they get bad reviews hahaha brave and maybe stupid calling shashi for interview and then bringing the accusations murder against his wife damn didnt think would,1
and nobody acknowledges the fact that was his followers who trended this even before narendra modi had changed his name chawkidar narendra modi sad but true,0
how long before the video will banned from india,0
suis chowkidar lol,1
new delhi day after prime minister narendra modi urged supporters take the pledge against corruption the changed his name twitter ‘chowkidar’ with bjp chief amit shah and several union ministers following suit this works not best counter attacking social media move rennet times lol,1
okay will honest they have completely nailed slogan congress and upa coffin the team bjp really amazing also feel free drop some contents chowkidar related same,1
will watching tonight love hasan minaj hopefully good,1
just hope doesn get taken down from netflix india quickly there anything minutely against bjp should watch right now,1
just lost several brain cells after the reading the comments this episode abcdesis lol,1
over stuffed episode went through too many topics demonetization religious extremism and just didn have time them justice,1
loved the episode been watching the series since the beginning and this was far the best one because something you know close his personal experiences well obviously was critical more the bjp being the ruling party but also highlighted the deficiencies the congress also kudos tharoor for coming even though knew would lampooned and the sunanda pushkar case brought again,1
just wondering weather john oliver will also cover the topic like did his first ever episode,1
just watched decent think there were lot topics cover and not enough time tried keep impartial slightly anti bjp possible without making too many controversial statements mostly sounds like quick summary recent indian political atmosphere for non indians and nris was also smart enough have tiptoed around the kashmir topic with restricting his comments the pulwama attacks and airstrikes think that was wise both for his and netflix sake,1
the general narrative against muslims too ignorant have full faith indian muslims,1
too much content for odd minute episode was largely anti bjp expected since most comedians are anti establishment but talking about indian elections got present both sides impartial but that hard expect this time and age,1
appreciating good work regardless political parties what everyone should,1
has tried touch upon all bases happens such cases the issue oversimplified and the picture distorted the end india one big generalization where himdus are looking for domination and muslims are innocent targets,1
bakchodi are just kids these guys are real bakchods,1

thanissaro bhikkhu “ all know what happens when fire goes out the flames die down and the fire gone for good when first learn that the name for the goal buddhist practice nibbana nirvana literally means the extinguishing fire hard imagine deadlier image for spiritual goal utter annihilation turns out though that this reading the concept mistake translation not much word image what did extinguished fire represent the indians the buddha day anything but annihilation according the ancient brahmans when fire was extinguished went into state latency rather than ceasing exist became dormant and that state — unbound from any particular fuel — became diffused throughout the cosmos when the buddha used the image explain nibbana the indian brahmans his day bypassed the question whether extinguished fire continues exist not and focused instead the impossibility defining fire that doesn burn thus his statement that the person who has gone totally out can described however when teaching his own disciples the buddha used nibbana more image freedom apparently all indians the time saw burning fire agitated dependent and trapped both clinging and being stuck its fuel burned ignite fire one had seize when fire let its fuel was freed released from its agitation dependence and entrapment — calm and unconfined this why pali poetry repeatedly uses the image extinguished fire metaphor for freedom fact this metaphor part pattern fire imagery that involves two other related terms well upadana clinging also refers the sustenance fire takes from its fuel khandha means not only one the five heaps form feeling perception thought processes and consciousness that define all conditioned experience but also the trunk tree just fire goes out when stops clinging and taking sustenance from wood the mind freed when stops clinging the khandhas thus the image underlying nibbana one freedom the pali commentaries support this point tracing the word nibbana its verbal root which means unbinding what kind unbinding the texts describe two levels one the unbinding this lifetime symbolized fire that has gone out but whose embers are still warm this stands for the enlightened arahant who conscious sights and sounds sensitive pleasure and pain but freed from passion aversion and delusion the second level unbinding symbolized fire totally out that its embers have grown cold what the arahant experiences after this life all input from the senses cools away and she totally freed from even the subtlest stresses and limitations existence space and time the buddha insists that this level indescribable even terms existence nonexistence because words work only for things that have limits all really says about — apart from images and metaphors — that one can have foretastes the experience this lifetime and that the ultimate happiness something truly worth knowing the next time you watch fire going out see not case annihilation but lesson how freedom found letting ” html,1
buddhism are taught that once arahantship attained and have reached nibbana the cycle samsara broken and arahant vanishs just like flame the concept flame ancient india differnt than the common modern conception based this arhant aware and conscious after death the question not applicable surely better stuck samara where get experience positive experiences well negative any experience better than none what ever this the clinging and thirsting referred the second noble truth what you precieve better the cause dukkha,1
you still householder lay person but according the website literature somehow equal the bhikkus and bhikkunis can you provide some context here lay ordination the order interbeing just begins with the five precepts which has been rebranded the five mindfulness trainings not sure what that supposed mean eventually you work taking the bodhisattva precepts which our tradition based the upasakasila sutra involving six major precepts and minor precepts the site describes taking days mindfulness per year what those days look like entail this probably reference uposatha observance guess here that divided into days month around the full moon and new moon lineage does days month plus holidays which probably comes out days well basically what the value lay ordination being normal householder fully ordained monk normal householder has not taken ordination the precepts and likely has only taken the three refuges that all not quite sure what you asking here about value though ordained laity have personal relationship with their preceptor who may may not their master and have begun the zen path earnest those who only taken the three refuges are still the stage cultivating merit and their practice most likely falls primarily the devotional side also primarily theravada practitioner would find the teachings thay zen lineage compatible would they allow continue studying from theravadan perspective tremendous deal vietnamese thien based the contents the pali nikayas chinese agamas and commentarial works early sravakayana teachers like shigao far contemporary mahayana goes think likely the most sravayana set lineages most laity will never even approach the more traditional chan style teachings they are typically reserved for monastics very advanced lay disciples the bulk practice particularly for laity with sravakayana methods either mindfulness breath mindfulness buddha with the intent progressing through the dhyanas into samadhi thien dinh sometims called stillness english not sure what tnh lineage calls colloquially english edit should point out that the order interbeing broader than just tnh lineage now many different but related vietnamese thien lineages have coalesced into the order including own pure land thien lineage but far know they are all lieu quan thien,1
hasan played safe stating only the obvious could dug deeper but that would open can worms and would detract from the spirit his show overall good episode see lot nutjobs abcd stating that netflix committing commercial suicide pandering the left india yeah shit isn like they don know especially with hasan minhaj the host criticizing the indian right wing would bring them disapproval obvious that they have thought this through,1
india first america first,1

this fight boi look the little freaks gotta bow,0
whats super metro city while our country busy investing heavily defense space exploration and various initiatives forget that there are regions india which lack basic living necessities the same true for literally every nation that invests space exploration disingenuous put all you eggs one basket space exploration has its own importance states still lives under poverty line self declared superpower promoting digital india how does expect one use those digital instruments without power the same also promoting 100 electrification but you succinctly choose ignore that again diversification the the hallmark well thought out plan for democracy been years and many still struggle with such basic needs are really developing yes are developing reddit com neoliberal comments 9hu673 over 270m india moved out poverty over 270m india moved out poverty years india was suppose achieve generating capacity 2022 but achieved january last year tooth implant australia can cost whilst india costs from another reddit post “swachh bharat abhiyan” which the government spending billion building million toilets rural parts india the government has constructed million toilets since 2014 reducing the number persons who openly defecate from 550 million fewer than 150 million 2018 many more but take leave,1
the times when our beloved promoting digital india how does expect one use those digital instruments without power you know right that the same guy pushing for 100 electrification,1
seems randia have pretty low bar for entertainment and very big aspiration for validation from outsiders pretending know about india this was underwhelming but then again not really aimed for avoid and better watch kamra,1

pubg shit anyways,0
completely unbiased totally not one sided lol,1
overhyped pretty bland imo,1
think naveen patnaik might join him may jagan but that and people here and there 120 too much but definitely useful number the fact lot activists hyderabad support him for his federal front not because not corrupt the answer but because wants scrap the concurrent list people down south have had enough bjp and congress shit for way too long voices need get louder about decentralizing subjects from the centre and seems doing just that joining bjp will blow him the future and won join congress long equidistant one has any issue,1
check his background better than congress bjp maybe even worse owns all the media the state and spend public money his own glorification worst all the third fronters imo,0
everyone knows bjp guy and all this federal front crap cut into opposition numbers and jagan will definitely support nda,0
found boring,0
trying find right wing bjp supporters and muslim haters comment cant see lot impressed,1
reminded that scene from swades where old woman standing front bulb and when lights she says bijli swades such underrated movie,1
absofckinglutely hate the fanatics that bjp rule has brought with its rule but bluntly honest even farm now has good hrs supply electricity and the roads are great well farm border and actually used have 7hrs elec supply with roads that never survived the monsoons,1
bjp guy don fall for his crap,0
haha true,1
wondered the kitkat had anything with elections but then was more concerned with eating,1
because good administrator compared others have all the skill required for being good politician have good speaking and manipulating skills hardworking talks what people wants hear moreover there large proportion indian voters that are nationalists supporting right wing for them specially modi hero other called right wing leader can match his chrisma currently except yogi aditynath maybe third other opposition leader good politician narendra modi specifically rahul seems forced politics don think have any interest politics whatsoever all talks are freebies like women reservation loan waiver farm subsidies etc,1
frustrating does this man ever get positive even neutral coverage,0
family came over the 1900s when irish “need not apply” reparations are such stupid idea bernie has right,0
yes did leave lot things out but come had too little time well done,0
look ’ okay bernie did good job with those unfair questions and was able answer them clearly and his team know the kind questions the msm will ask him and they’ prepared anyways because ’ amazing communicator have some more faith the guy and stop sulking,1
get this article sanders campaign stat case for reparations included disadvantaged white 1790876391 you really want reparations you approach them way that brings people together whether you agree with that not you have concede sanders good company,1
the fact that they keep asking him why needs run should convince you that does need run wasn threat the establishment would not questioned more and more someone correct wrong but never heard anyone ever ask another candidate why they needed run and funny because 2016 most republican candidates had very similar platform biden joining the race white old men love see npr ask him why needs run has about other candidates who are running moderate platform,1
their coverage 2016 bernie was terrible they were the hillary camp quickly the 500 superdelegates were least they still lean liberal,0
there are other places electioneering propaganda lets keep reddit for stuff that worth reading about,1
certain candidates bernie and tulsi are the most prominent this regard are going get the questions intended discredit them can stop just push through,1
its just that common india audience fed with all propaganda about modi like how works for hrs day etc and this their first time internet and they literally believe truth they are under the impression that the political posters about modi etc are all true and since these involve him giving strong poses which show him authority they believe that strong hard working leader they have hard time understanding that these posters are made from the cell and meant show modi favorable light,1
you read the complete quote what she saying that farmer said \,1
amusing but one sided hassan you are not fooling anyone,1
what popular not always right,1
how the fuck popular even after fucking many major policy decisions even when sorta communal and seems erode democracy practices that where you are wrong bro lot people support him precisely because communal that and the propaganda you don need find complicated explanation something simple,1
lol few decades people will look during this decade with the same sort disbelief and pity reserved for the germans the forties,1
because internet has gotten cheap and misinformation spreading like wildfire take decade adjust the new normal modi the chetan bhagat politics his only fans are people who only recently come online seasoned bigots digging his own and bjp grave though will down history the worst,1
modi moron who has failed every front the kind idiot who thinks building diplomatic ties means has hug every world leader become fraands has understanding economics comes with schemes and yojnas that don really work the real world the basic reason why this failed leader very popular because the majority hindus india especially upper caste educated ones have disliked the minorities for long time and now they have their guy power the feel they have all the power now modi does not inspire confidence leader any reasonable person the man communal idiot who will divide india will get elected again for personally even rahul inspires more confidence despite his inexperience because isn bad person modi,0
’ nearing john oliver’ level with some these and indian guy holy cow this was accurate,1
what find absolutely unbelievable that centrist outlets are now cynically trying pretend that there any support whatsoever for reparations any mainstream political circles all means npr cnn msnbc the dnc the dccc etc want start bandwaggoning cynically for reparations for the descendants slaves please make fucking happen but what unbelievably ironic that they are the ones standing the way being politically feasible feel like taking fucking crazy pills,0
promo done with 500 million dollars won fade away that easily,1
because incredible propoganda indian media and whatsapp people only see the selective clips modi and rahul modi beijing rahul london now explain which one represented their country better here,1
inspires people have met several people who want like modi even when they knew barely anything about him outside his speeches have also met many people who read and know about him like role model what exactly they find inspiring what way they want like him met people who say pretty much the same thing you said but they never have answer how why they inspired invariably all boils down what other choice have rahul gandhi haven received single answer that doesn involve other options,1
hah don’ live india anymore but still follow portions the end ’ the same they all are bunch crooks didn’ take minutes tell you that  bjp way advanced with social media now though they have army paid tweeters who will come after you you say anything else central committee writes tweets and they all individually tweet make trend congress had scam bjp’ ineptness demonetisation and the rafael scam and tight control supposedly free media going the other way,1
watched the episode and panned out exactly like thought would didn expect anything less from hasan who regularly panders the left the comparison modi and trump was laughable best was obvious attempt demonize modi but doesn actually talk about what modi has done for the welfare india don understand why leftists america have demonize right wing parties india could have talked about how all the other options are pathetic and talked though bjp has falsely labelled rahul but really rahul has brought about his own downfall doing stupid things overall very superficial and left leaning episode,0
really don villages have village chowkidar,1
she really gives competition raga being silly,0
when you reach top with just your last name,1
that interview was awful was also annoyed that considered legitimate question say you old white male you not what want what you think about that this kind narrow thinking plays right into trump gop why can discuss the substance policies and character instead the piece was presented opening statements get know the candidates but they hit him with nothing but loaded questions that had carefully navigate,0

would love hear from black people bernie supporters and non they feel bernie policies are enough boost communities general level the playing field more still needs done living the southwest doing social work for the past decade know that low ses families all sorts are struggling much exactly why support bernie much being white not easy choosing side feeling uninformed previously have been all for reparations hello social worker now wonder bernie policies boost all communities would enough get everybody where they need slavery and the institutionalized racism that has continued well past insidious stain our country our treatment native communities and immigrants all colors over the years well what enough fuck know let get more voices talking about the media damned insistent bringing which never happened 2016 from what recall,1
but problem with this question why all the sudden all these media outlets care about reparations when they absolutely gave fucks about ever until became easy talking point discredit sanders you answered yourself they doing specifically discredit sanders pretty much their job this point much more and much worse yet come,1
you guys can have all these experts opinions about namo but the truth will after elections also seriously don know what happened other political parties seems like team these political parties are also namo fan saying that because the things they are doing are much that people are definitely gonna for namo and plus people must always choose best option among available that why namo much accepted,1
really don think either these questions unfair they both great opportunities for sanders make the case for himself sanders ran 2016 the assertion that was the only candidate who was pushing for single payer system living wages intense program for climate action etc was compelling argument and ’ certainly why supported him that definitely not the case this time around and that large part thanks bernie pushing the envelope but does mean that got make the case now that the best candidate achieve those goals happen think uses the question opportunity stake his claim ’ going tackle the issue grassroots movement builder rather than policy wonk aiming for middle ground that coupled with consistent record what makes him stand out says much what’ the issue trying say reparations has only become issue “ easy talking point discredit sanders ” actually disingenuous reporters like astead wesley have been asking candidates about the issue since before sanders announced ’ become issue because activists have made issue should know where candidates stand “forcing” candidate clarify their positions good thing the african american community supposed scrutinize sanders’ position someone has ask him the question can’ continue say “actually the young white berniebro story myth and our community cares about these minority issues” and then get defiant when someone asks question about minority issue those issues are only brought way attack our guy there are plenty reasons critical 2020 reporting but really don’ think questions like this are,1
hope gets paytm freecharge google pay phone discounts for his first electricity bill payment dont hope better teach him how get,1
hopefully reach 100 electrification 2020 real shame can provide 19th century technology all our population even today,1
has with the stark difference between the way congress does things and the way modi doing almost anything that happens seen the perspective how fucked upa was over the years honest hear lot about fucking major policy decisions but can tell you that geopolitical stance india hasn been better place than now upa drobe the country into place where china was fast taking over the oceans around and there wasn much activity with regard nuclear activities india was going out the map modi brought back into the map with resounding tune and feel for that deserves better term the thing one great all vote for what think important note bandi was good because genuinely love using upi over cards and the advent the whole digital revolution moving india forward leaps and bounds,1
koch walton and heavily dnc connected npr does not like bernie never have will remember 2016 segments wait wait don tell making fun his age for over minutes the reparations question seems direct line attack him and try sow poor feelings african american communities either way would good for the campaign get more solid statement this and not keep pushing off because clearly going coming back,1
just want point out that yes there media bias from msm against bernie but not for the reason people usually cite the msm isn biased because they are corporatists anti progressive the bias new story old story news editors bernie old news they can run the same thing again and again about how great bernie they have switch new angles about how not good these new people just the nature journalism now days not saying this isn bad just saying the bias systemic problem the way incentivize news,1
yes pains say but npr has become mouth piece for conservative political views noticed during the iraq war they were supportive the government postion all the other media giants here article about where npr gets its funding from which explains their bias national public radio national propaganda radio,1
the times when our beloved promoting digital india how does expect one use those digital instruments without power lol you are criticising the same guy who responsible for the electrification your friend village give credit where due,1
\ the times when our beloved promoting digital india how does expect one use those digital instruments without power was with you until here lol,1

wow really cant tell they biased not,1
netflix will now get them negative reviews and stars,0
was honestly very disappointed with this episode mainly because two reasons stretched itself out too far mentioning too many things and not diving into them did not provide historical context the country illustrate how wounded and its people actually are the second point particular would help understand why people india are heavily influenced identity politics understand that minutes not enough time but the burden responsibility falls onto him did not think was balanced not bhakt ideally don think should even have clarify any post whether bhakt not but does change things this subreddit,1
like most minhaj stuff this was super predictable and played too hard for jokes which were low hanging fruit anyway was neither fresh nor insightful then again this was meant primer the current indian political scene for global audience,1

seriously doubt the authenticity this news how did the police the people knew that they were playing pubg play pubg lot and can definitely say people playing the game would’ definitely heard the train coming unless they were wearing some strong headphones because while playing the game will closely monitoring all the sounds the game especially enemy footsteps person can hear those slight enemy footsteps the game then believe they can definitely hear the train from long distance for this looks like coverup something different altogether simply blaming the game get banned,0
train accidents are very frequent india this stuff doesn even down media many times they are just using pubg for clicks,1

reminds this article how much this government boasts that has jumped the ease doing business rankings but ground realities like that tales are entirely different,1
" see lot posts these days complaining about various government policies but only after these policies have started pinching the poster personally being cynic gives some hope see that people end changing their political stance atleast once reality sets however also deeply wish that these posters can hold such viewpoints when when are not the ones directly affected there are several issues affecting large underprivileged and mostly voiceless population for which these people should raising voices well the following lines penned martin niemoller are something which often think about and hope more people join the protest support others causes too first they came for the socialists and did not speak out—
because was not socialist then they came for the trade unionists and did not speak out—
because was not trade unionist then they came for the jews and did not speak out—

director small software product private limited company here since the birdbrain modi has come into power implemented gst with little clarity many things and tons paperwork the service tax system was much more clearer and simpler gst joke exports are 100 tax free and they still are but now have submit bond every year tying significant percentage revenue low interest bank has made effort rein angel tax taxing all investments venture capitalists income made many payment restrictions indian credit card processors that have use foreign processor which charges very high commission and bank transfer fees then decided that can use foreign processors charge indian cards had split the billing software product into two different systems and its mess and now this selfie thing its waste time and money especially the registered address not the same address the one work from its residential address gotta get board and put and wondering how the fuck does this help detect illegitimate businesses modi fucking moron every decision that makes like demonitization just wakes farts gets idea and implements without any consultantion research logical thinking,1
before the 2014 elections modi used say paraphrasing don any work just have people doing the work for table usually empty and just coordinate between them think passed down these kinds thoughts his underlings the centre well the idea has been push all the work the people and the businesses instead doing anything substantial crack down illegal things the way gst works right now makes impossible 100 compliant anyway customers don know the rules and tbh with many changes every now and then neither and they expect flexible with them even means not complying with the law the b2b space that just means death the business also people who think trading not legitimate business should understand how actually works and benefits the market before making stupid comments against the baniyas running such smes lots manufacturers don like selling b2c because increases the hassle dealing with customers they are not equipped deal with and because they directly own their production units which have run regular basis they want minimum order quantity which small retail establishment small multi brand outlet home business side income for housewives usually run people who are transacting well below the purview almost all regulatory compliances cannot possibly achieve they rely b2b wholesale businesses bring about the volumes needed even brands with name recognition like blackberry oxemberg and jack jones this last one surprised too when heard about run separate distribution large mbo division drive the volumes whether old stock not immaterial they need b2b sell large quantities the way this government has gone about things they want either fuck over our customers they don follow the rules are expected follow even though they are not required they know still vote for them apparently because the community generally anti muslim and fear mongering and chest thumping are easy way keep distracted from the real problems hand mean they successfully cultivated the narrative over the past two decades that the muslim population percentage grows too much they will want the imposition sharia first for their own community and later for the population large that why they will get away with this shit,1
this true has send that selfie thing few days ago and now ’ totally pissed company fully remote don’ have any office think will taking selfie outside home ’ already planning shut company here and move canada using express entry,1

honestly don believe loan waivers and reservations can anything for the progress this nation sustainable economic and industrial reforms and developments can only boost this nation modi more focussed industry and economics while gandhi more focussed loan waivers and stuff modi wants people earn while gandhi giving freebies can give much sources have little time till break gets over,1
this entire there other option modi who exactly the narrative bjp wants portray they are banking the fact that people will vote for modi strong personality rather than reality check and see the bjp has really achieved anything fair bjp has achieved few things there have been major fuck ups demobilisation increased intolerance towards minorities etc but some their policies have been good too however majority the voting population don care about these things and bjp knows that,1

tamils and keralites are over represented their seats should reduced bjp cares about nation they should divide into more states but article says india should have 2000 mps that wont make good hall for debates 500 correct number cms but current indian system any day better than usa senate where all states have seats each maybe rajya sabha can have similar system,1
the bjp welcomed congress leader shashi tharoor aunt and her husband into the party fold function kochi friday but faced embarrassment they said they were already supporters the party shashi tharoor aunt sobhana sasikumar and her husband sasikumar said they had been long time supporters the bjp and wondered why such function was organised welcome them into the party when reporters approached tharoor relatives the duo said they had been long time supporters the bjp and did not know why such function was organised welcome them and asked the media put the question bjp leaders why was held and left the venue mallu hai political bullshit doesn work with them even from their own party they love,1

alleppey gonna arif ldf this time this was sure udf seat would have contested don think shanimol has what takes stand against arif arif proven contender aroor mla and has lot good will what shanimol has election failures 2006 and 2016 this will her third failure vishnunadh would have been far better choice don know what with congress man they take all the good leaders mullappalli etc and give them party posts while booloka duranthams like rajmohan unnithan shanimol usman and muralidharan are contesting the elections don they want win elections what,1
thiruvananthapuram and think sashi takes this time there ain modi wave and kummanam rajagopal think they fielded the worse possible candidate they could was enjoying nice retirement job manipur and they dragged him outta there trivandrum the bjp strongest constituency and they should have gone with ulli sura but they fricking fight much within the party that they would basically ensured sura doesn get his name anywhere near the ballot box,1
trivandrum tharoor will win kummanam will come second divakaran probably the best party candidate cpi could muster but going lose badly lot left supporters the last two elections voted for tharoor 2009 and split between tharoor and rajagopal 2014 specifically because cpi candidate and the other candidates were heavyweights tharoor should get better margin this time the nadar vote that was split last time with bennet abraham should come back him rajagopal lost last time despite coming top five assembly constituencies because fell the third place the coastal nadar belt attingal sampath most likely win though the margin might reduce extremely popular politician across party lines congress has chance only the bjp candidate overperforms and takes vote from ldf which quite unlikely,1
kollam feel nkp will win premachandran pretty well liked kollam and has also worked hard get some long pending projects like the kollam bypass and the sengottai gauge conversion completed has also been very active the parliament,1
orthodox faction traditionally congress but veena will get some vote from this base anto antony lack charisma but will get christian votes and hindu votes due mala issue there will increase bjp vote share but doubtful whether that they can win,0
kasarkode this one easy congress could have given better fight but they spoiled their chances completely fielding unnithan the only hope for him get some bjp votes bjp fields weak candidate still ldf will win very comfortably,1

absolutely true there are few more things that should included when looking his appeal firstly his strongman image india and also worldwide there trend towards people who make brash provocative statements being seen strong leaders trump for instance considered his supporters stronger leader than obama though the latter actually carried out more deportations and got osama killed modi takes step further and combines with bold not necessarily good initiatives like demo and the recent air strikes against pakistan now well known that demo was complete failure and what the air strikes actually achieved terms strategic objectives unclear best but from political perspective country like india these are brilliant moves after demo people were saying idea was good only implementation was bad though implementation optional component the govt responsibilities and not the most important component course the idea itself was insane but let not there this has led the least doing something syndrome despite the fact that previous govts also have done something yet that perception has been created and modi excellent spotting this key differentiator that why the govt keeps harping about nehru and other past and dead pms that why every bjp shill keeps parroting the white lie that nothing happened years combine that with the notion that everything the has done historic even when essentially rebranded existing initiatives but his greatest trump card was and will always rahul gandhi not only because that man walking gaffe machine fair modi but modi has carefully created media network that will suppress this fact the real problem with raga and his sister they are boy scout politicians raga seems have forgotten that the three state elections were not the thumping inc victories that were expected the inc won them very narrowly all modi needed turn the tide was major national crisis modi being political genius quickly seized upon pulwama even person who intensely dislikes modi and extremely skeptical his handling pulwama cannot imagine raga handling any better than modi finally has said that the alternatives are not very promising raga shitshow mamata the next most likely candidate just fascist and authoritarian modi not more most the opposition alliances only exist beat modi that the only glue holding these rivals together should they succeed that glue will dissolve and most people know this,1

probably another fake news,0
tbh most asian countries not want have best performing currency because they are mostly export oriented india has huge trade deficit and strong rupee would help the economy china japan taiwan asean nations and countries would hurt their currency become stronger they often take policies make their currencies weaker,1
this relative rupees fallen level recently and recovered from there — huge recovery and thats why small time window seems good performance but you expand the time window and take yearly avg then you realise one worst performing currencies,0
like how everything falling place for the now rupee stronger and oil price stable same thing happened 2014 during elections one lucky sob,1
the turnaround has been fuelled the improved chances prime minister narendra modi winning second term noob here how does that work,1
well done bcci you did good,1
thanks bcci warna hame har chowkidar chowkidaari karte hue dekhna padta,1
academia most are brainwashed urban naxal and anything even remotely positive about modi gets the response what are you kidding you support modi reeeeeeee they react some uneducated communal bigoted person mocked and most them come from educated families while the ones coming from average not intellectual family support modi the called intellectuals are modi hater and average indian supports modi have had conversation with cab driver kolkata young guy almost age who wanted join army but cudnt because family needed him work asked you support modi said yes was sooooo happy said most people who are patriotic support modi also going vote for him airport two security guards were talking the elder one who was about retire was painting modi someone scary bloodthirsty and saying won elected again the younger guy was while being respectful was still trying support modi saying that isn that bad and think will come back etc family close friends are modi supporter anyway sum the intellectuals hate modi and consider anyone supporting for modi bigoted person the older generation also less likely support modi the average indian young indian like support modi think leftist wave limited the internet intellectuals only edit also circle mostly the intellectuals who are outspoken and discuss politics while modi supporters mostly remain quite after election dates were announced guy who wants kashmir separated from india and thinks phulwama was result what indian army has done kashmiris was loudly saying how modi has made south indian states have single phase larping some conspiracy theories his neutral friends was soo hilarious asked him any chance whatsapp forward that you took bit too seriously,1
sometimes think randians are indian not and why they sound like pakistani,1
randians are right about everything they think about india they should realise that india has had several decades left wing government and now may the time for the right wing rule least for one more term don’ expect miracles but even bjp shows that they have proper vision how fix all the issues may they should stick around for couple more terms,1
thanks atleastafool for the excellent effort post what would you say india best hope for market oriented reforms and democratic liberalism the future,1

2002 narendra modi the current india and then rss hardliner mismanaged riot and turned into state sponsored pogrom gave the rioters free hand and several his mlas and ministers were convicted rioting instigating the riots and giving the rioters list muslim owned houses was investigated special investigation team sit report exonerates modi the highlights 473243 html appointed the supreme court india under congress government and cleared all guilt another court later upheld this verdict one major reason lost was the fact that was deemed too moderate and ‘anti hindu’ while this probably some the reason lost should mentioned here that the results were total surprise everyone and contradicted the polls quite bit one the hindu right going vote for congress and turnout was still somewhat high though modi had campaigned these things and tried more moderate and economic focused the first few years lost track far all the major policies under him have either been economic foreign policy related the only major social policies under him have been letting the court making rulings social policy without interference homosexuality triple talaq and repealing the hajj subsidy due rise right wing nationalism there were multiple lynchings muslims which modi was silent the cow lynchings part absolutely true they have risen since got elected however modi has condemned lynchings indias modi condemns violence name cow worship iduskbn19k13s though criticizing him the speed his response valid point fake news say hasn condemned the government also demonetized the economy late 2016 win elections don think was win and haven really heard that until now the government claims have done for variety reasons overall the effects seem the government has failed its objective make harder launder money demonetization caused significant dip gdp growth the objective reduce terrorism was achieved naxalite communist terrorists were forced surrender masse some areas though whether this trend has sustained debated addition tax collection increased and continuing the increase the party currently using terrorist attacks for political gains they responded terror attack likely backed pakistan attacking terrorists they have done this twice the first which confirmed video while the second which contested idea how striking back can construed some sort exploitation event congress party has some nutty policies they barely have policies the bjp stands for something while the congress stands for getting the congress power the party has been ruled historically corrupt political dynasty for bit now and functions making populist promises well appealing certain demographics usually their winning coalition consists minority religions which why they blocked shah bano certain castes hindus and any farmers they can win over they usually will propose some sort pro farmer policies right now they playing the role opposition party fairly well but almost too well they just contradicted everything the bjp has said without offering too much platform past pure populism there couple people who are actual true heart congress believers but for most people matter substance and some corruption better worse than hindu nationalism these parties want wreck the indian economy and are supported ‘economists’ from leftist indian universities while this absolutely true throw the commies bone here like the bjp and unlike the congress they actually stand for something and are fairly noncorrupt they been ruling the state kerala for while now and the state has some really really good indicators good fact one the few examples communists can point when asked about the success communism don really have responses past this point just expressing thoughts individual parties tmc this one more just ranting than actual response mamata herself congress the extreme while congress this election has been adopting soft hindutva which basically translates visiting temples mamata has like said been accused various anti hindu things not mention outright forbidding processions for fairly important hindu holiday allow muslim holiday continue without fear violence bahujan samaj party takes advantage casteist feelings the extreme indian politics identity politics the bjp tries make blocs vote religion and congress does caste whoever wins the lower caste hindu like india white working class swing vote vote wins the election bsp caste based politics turned party for low castes precipitated giving low castes more power for those you who don know india has what republicans think affirmative action the states namely they reserve certain number seats colleges and government jobs for minorities and more importantly historically underpriviledged castes now you get situations where historically privileged castes vote blocs get reservation status and certain castes are thrown under the bus they were historically priv but don have enough numbers significant voting bloc and ofc mayawatis solution give upper castes cms reservation too ncp ncp the nationalist congress party like the congress ncp also social democratic but also appeals indian civic nationalism the party opposed sonia gandhi being congress leader the party opposes indian citizens ‘unnatural’ origins from holding public offices that why was created sonia longer leader and they just usually form coalition with congress they probably close the center but still secular shiv sena you hit this one pretty much right the nail also like say the gujurat riots the one modi was blamed for prompted the leader the shiv sena call muslims cancer aam admi party along with bjp congress and left this the only party with national name recognition lol they literally confined delhi and like other states where they have legislative presence basically delhi aap just talked lot about because indian liberals love and the idea also the left doesn have ton real presence either they have about seats the lok sabha combined tdp this one fairly accurate and pretty sad honest the direction the party pretty free floating andhra needs some development after losing hyderabad aimim– aimim the islamic equivalent the bjp seeks establish islamic democracy india and often resorts hate based rhetoric like advocating genocide more like the islamic equivalent the shiv sena also they only somewhat relevant their home state telangana they have exactly one seat the lok sabha,1

friendly reminder that happiness indices there are several them are self reported report study and problematic the cantril ladder method used measure happiness the world happiness report this method respondents are asked think ladder with the best possible life for them being and the worst possible life being they are then asked rate their own current lives that scale this excellent article economics happiness html sumit mishra explains why problematic the problem with such methodologies that the data the answers the questions are not independent space and time some countries people might shy away from responding positively even when they are actually “happy the other hand some people may compelled respond that they are satisfied with their lives because the prevalent norms the society community they live this makes the cross country comparison happiness deeply problematic the reliability surveys tracking happiness over time equally dodgy consider someone who has lost job today and she reports score the happiness survey three years later she still chooses although she’ back the workforce this problem known hedonic treadmill psychology the idea fairly simple people return their usual levels mood fairly quickly after major event their lives new job marriage etc,1

can another country influence the outcome democratic election esp successful democracy russians probably did most recently and fear pakistan has also done well you see before pulwama things were falling place people started talking about issues bjp was backfoot and seemed that change will happen and bjp will shown its place but after pulwama and balakot things changed abruptly and now seems modi will most probably win another term not forget the absolute ineptness and infighting the opposition helped great deal the bjp now call conspiracy theorist you want but cant help but wonder that did pakistan pulloff the greatest con job the democratic world post cold war,1
yes sir its totally legal even bjp funds with party fund there constraint party spending elections for propaganda start campaigners 2nd corporates has right free speech and they express with donations 3rd the wave nationalism worth exploiting commercial enterprise see the business uri movies like saragrahi indian are conveyor belt and for those who are saying indians are liking fascism and jingoism will say they are being biased everyone lured marketing moreover democracy meant representative society criticising society and indians for choosing some party shows the selective approach critics,1

this may true but coming from the son the person who reduced the office something even lesser status the message not going fly public opinion,1
without this being defence the present government but congress records with respect the office the prime minister was not any better not worse veteran journalist kuldip nayyar has stated book published posthumously that files from the pmo used sonia gandhi for approval that sense having publicity minister doesn seem whole lot degradation,1
the prime minister imposing mediocrity sophisticated country holyshit color impressed with statement,1
unsparing his assault modi rahul also wondered whether the prime minister ever studied university and alleged educational institutions were undergoing saffronisation under his watch modi has reduced the prime minister office the status publicity minister office busy marketing himself earlier said still have access his university degree nobody actually knows went university not there rti application delhi seeking degree but has not been responded gandhi said adding the prime minister imposing mediocrity sophisticated country,1
hope this doesn through but this highlights one the core issues will facing coming decades are power hungry nation and need generate cheap power although the share thermal power generation will down the future can down fast enough and don have immediate alternatives,1
atrocious,0
such things are best addressed opposition parties when they are all keeping silent for reasons best known only them don think there anything people can whole none the opposition parties seem have much enthusiasm for anything nowadays also large section society malleable that can get influenced mediocre actors into following drama peddling pied piper doom then means laws and institutions stopped mattering them long ago,1
didn’ know who modi was 2014 remember watching election results with friends and people around were excited one guy explained all why modi was the best choice for arnab shouted enthusiastically and everything seemed merry brushed off allegations against him stories opposition one colleagues who against modi started discussing modi and first defended him after all did put good show first years rolled got harder and harder defend this guy stopped discussing politics with colleague because doesn’ really suit work environment but didn’ need those discussions clearly see what was wrong with modi beliefs were strongly shaken when allowed people like yogi come power and the agenda shifted from development and setting institutions setting cow sheds started watching stand comedy youtube and other interviews like shut kunal and the reasoning “anti nationals” started making sense more and more every single allegation whether crony capitalism fostering hostile communal environment has come true may have done some good for the country but the bad definitely outweighs the good this not progressive candidate for would truly disastrous another years with the way things are going,1

this news coming from leftist news service really making sense sarcasm,1
this thewire https thewire purely biased,1
the title click bait best india not bruised idea india has well established constitution laws regulations and the necessary institutions back which are run competent people for the most part very few countries has this and india has been able grow into mature democracy yes modi has stirred religious right wingers and lot things has done supports determinantl society whole yes congress has done its part appease lot religious groups communities get votes not trying down play any damage any shity has done the past but one two shitty are not going any damages that irreversible the biggest thing understand here that the democratic process india works for the most part when there political will the right thing things get done real quick aap delhi good example aap has the ability what has done because the necessary departments institutions laws etc are place this took decades built the other day saw one police officer from the motor vehicle department single handily clear major traffic block made over 200 vehicles all sizes less than mins did this while pulling aside the truck driver who caused the block pulling his vehicle documents and his drivers licence have liberal governments being voted out for right wing government who also has the ability voted out and vice versa has happened before and will happen again most importantly the coming generation care less for religious bullshit politics,1
the idea india overrated congress being decimated because they centralized power diverse country like india should and can only thrive decentralized polity but the hindustani has viewed every other linguistic and ethnic group with suspicion and result today consumed the communal schism partition that never addressed honest manner long the indian identity centered around the hindustani will always weak and pathetic idea,0
don support modi and wouldn like bjp come back power but don think are left with much choice here rahul gandhi doesn evoke lot confidence prime minister fair his reactions anything far hasn shown him better leader run india also don really believe another modi government will destroy india the current world one government can only slow down the economy the very most not kill fact another term for bjp may force the opposition more organised and understand what the country needs,1
wanted share conversation had with bro who ostensibly secular closet modi bhakt says supports cos economics policies and then proceeds find some positive with demo also asked him bhai for old times sake don you feel bad about the cow lynching admits considers them his failure not able stop them but these things happened before also also appeasement policy why you feel victimized give one example where muslims get better deal over hindus said temples under govt mosques not said but how does that affect you and give that hurts you said wife doesn get holiday gujju new year but even though only celebrate eid that declared holiday was stunned truly secular brother has turned into closet fanatic past decades terms term propoganda for the curious let tell you his wife works for central govt and hence doesn get state specific holidays face palm moment for itna kachra kaise saaf hoga,0
couldnt agree more another term for this absolutely inept govt would mean that doing actual work matters very little long you can brainwash the public through pliant media,1

this isn very smart way thinking you have the state elections for the state parties then you may choose what you want however lok sabha elections are for choosing who rules the country the centre even you choose state party the end indeed between modi and rahul gandhi because the state parties will only send support alliance foreign relations defence governmental policy all the items national importance that are the national last under the constitution will dealt with centre fracturing the mandate voting for nondiscript state parties you will waste your vote and disservice the nation don that,0
yes will good but also have some negative effect but giving much powers states can lead separation often find india bunch diffrent countries put together keeping the power the central keeps united,1
exactly people think that voting for parties that aap waste time even you identify with their agenda because will probably never win majority that not the point indian elections aap going join some coalition anyway the point give the party you identify with power the centre chair the table that your demands are heard and enforced with threats leaving the coalition that how power works indian imo,0
anyone from here let know what happening over there modi will win again,1
damn one those guys who can thrash modi even with just using kind words can forget his speech for anyone who hasn listened here the link 65nmoc8hlco,1
what are the odds bsp winning here,1
opposition just plain squabbling and they will end giving the election plate bjp this guy here stay regardless,0
why would any political party other than maybe the commies want kanhaiya candidate what the hell does this guy represent,0
bjp wins they all should emigrate its win win situation tbh,1
thanks for this post good info one friends work who immigrated from india the the son some sort agricultural minister mumbai and been meaning ask him how the politics work over there this basically answers question,1
while the party has done good empower marginalized communities has idiotic policies like jobs reserved private sectors the bsp basically the dalit party and reservation affirmative action the dalit community somewhat analogous the black community the usa and mlk was inspired ambedkar who created the indian constitution concept reservation worth noting that reservation was not implemented properly until the early nineties which when the liberalization the indian economy began and the public sector began shrink imo entirely reasonable have reservation the private sector the public sector slowly privatized atleast until the dalits reach and maintain proportional representation all levels,1
change view feel left wing congress far more incompetent and harmful india rather than right wing bjp says uniform civil code can implemented bjp calls its progressive 116101300782 html ahmed khan shah bano begum the 1980s the vishva hindu parishad vhp began campaign for the construction temple dedicated rama the site with the bharatiya janata party bjp its political voice the movement was bolstered the decision district judge who ruled 1986 that the gates would reopened and hindus permitted worship there this decision was endorsed indian national congress politician rajiv gandhi then the prime minister india who sought regain support from hindus had lost over the shah bano controversy nonetheless the congress lost the 1989 general election and the bjp strength parliament grew from members making its support crucial the new government singh congress such dogla party even their appeasement they have done nothing substantial for muslims even now they deal issues with equal opportunities poverty living ghettos for the strata which needs the most simple enough point for say why can all agree rules are the same for all residents the country and large and cannot have different laws for different people based what they believe they keep supporting useless policies around religion property laws etc development they absolutely nothing should have progressed lot more from modi campaign which resonated with what did congress give mnerga allowed people dig gaddha look your work place person keeps consistently failing for doing job for years and then after small break year you think that the person will now better job its their dna people have changed the congress party what has anything changed since 2016,1

why you aap want form alliance kind thing with congress and not trust your own basic self you have done good work delhi and even the social media and media doesn show people delhi know,1
last year kejriwal government announced free tirth yatra for senior citizens you think this the right use tax money opportunistic and desperate measure gain votes several prominent leaders close arvind kejriwal have left aap you think because kejriwal has become dictatorial does this mean aap going path like other parties where party controlled individual family you think party has succumbed the issues the same politics that had sought fight kejriwal has maintained his earlier speeches that will never form alliance with any party but now looking form alliance with congress defeat bjp delhi aap different from others shouldn focusing delivering work which will speak for itself the elections instead focusing defeating another party,1
yeddy india most corrupt fucker has been been caught offering bribes many times phone calls buy mlas,1

congress completely the third party when comes delhi why the aap interested forming alliance with them the argument given kejriwal not divide anti bjp votes flawed people are far more unhappy with congress than bjp the alliance will only tarnish the image aap further and will not only affect them the coming elections but also the assembly elections,0

scribble some congress leaders names tomorrow with some amount beside their names and paste photocopied signature one their top leaders and tomorrow press conference demanding investigation into either provide some decent proof start attacking the bjp real issues like farmers distress and employment,1
why does aap sound desperate for alliance with congress also why does delhi have high crime rate due the fact that state government has power over the police,0
also the aap government has been power for some time now and with such overwhelming majority seats why have you not done anything regarding sheila dikshit despite pre poll promises rather trying allign with her party cms,1

why should delhi vote for you after disaster that you led delhi university and mcd elections losing those elections was still but manner which you lied own supporters that are winning all did not result now don trust anything that party dishes out expected results,1
what aap doing terms connecting with educated fellas earlier used passion for them then came the aap power for lot time became laughing matter someone said follows aap kejriwal most recently things are getting better people can see work done education and health point being elections are mostly battle perception than proof what done not done what you people are doing improve perception front,1

also why that become more like politician than what promised won his image has been tarnished because all had kept sizeable distance from regular country politics his good work would have gotten recognition from people all over india but the opposite and people just mock him and delhiites that chose clown and not see his good works had stuck delhi politics only would have been amazing and would have sweeped haryana punjab easily,1

what your position aadhaar and imposition aadhaar for anything that not made mandatory the supreme court ruling including welfare schemes understand that you were forced change your position this few months ago after people were not getting their owed welfare components but maybe time you decide what your position any form aadhaar imposition people this country why have you been collecting aadhaar and voter data from school students why have you been cold calling individual people about voter cancellation understand that real problem but calling individuals seems like shitty behavior your party representatives have been doing the same with holi message with long signature highlighting that they are contesting lok sabha election you even check people are dnd list before just calling them sending them texts can people opt out any form communication from your party,0
hello dilip what stance aap over many safety concerns delhi which hasnt improved why the alliance chased much with congress despite cursing congress and his motive was throw out corruption why shake hands with them again,1
what aspects aap differs from other national parties,0
first your party wanted alliance with congress then the deal did not work out kejriwal started abusing both congress and bjp this kind polictics was not promised aravind kejriwal why can aap replace kejriwal with right person,1
why new flyover and home guards promised why focus traffic issue and public transport why pollution mess delhi why you gave became much political said are not typical politicians then why you are asking congress again and again for alliance why reply ques open political funding anna hazare why politicised balakot delhi assembly that pakisani channels were showing footage,1

read answer quora but direct links aren allowed here just paste the answer here though the images the answer are lost also don agree with the answer completely but interesting counterpoint the general viewpoint have about hindutva question why did veer sawarkar form hindu mahasabha was atheist answer culture the physical manifestation individual spiritual immortality humans despite our mortal bodies crude natures flawed minds are luminous beings who can exist for millennia travel across oceans will and speak entire generations once under the right conditions for this one only one condition must met the individual must overcome their delusions mortality instead identify with immortal reality once that done all else follows the primary fallacy the average atheist makes the course their reading their belief that they somehow slipped off the chains religion delusion developed some sort individualistic freedom that nonsense the only thing they done exchange one set chains for another there absolutely difference between the rituals organized religion the flag marches communism for that matter liberal socialism there heaven religious liberal there was never any heaven merely duty never ending thankless duty part unknowing all knowing greater being with sense individual good evil even indifference that what the bhagavad gita actually says that what liberals don understand human beings want have part greater whole this sentiment the very basis humanity its civilizations its ethos religion like all ideologies merely another set lies meant justify the existence yet another unjust exploitative society because all societies their very collective existence are unjust exploitative the individual but that okay because human beings either want exploit exploited themselves even the holy liberals are bound their own set untruths and thus must constantly justifying arguing over group nonentities they not see that their stand absolute knowledge different from that adopted the christians muslims when they were persecuting being persecuted the pagans who preceded them there not single argument liberals have that hasn been raised ten thousand times earlier thomas aquinas lao tzu the buddha himself the mahabharata there not single argument the god delusion that hasn been discussed far more exhaustively dedicatedly comprehensively the tripitakas there isn single criticism the bible that wasn known countered thomas aquinas the individuals concerned thomas aquinas the buddha were not only far more intelligent learned enlightened than your liberal thinks they were all probability some the most intelligent beings grace this species the idea that they were foolish enough fall under some sort superstitious nonsense ridiculous they believe because choose chose order defend our chosen group the virtues sins this group whether this group christians hindus muslims even the people known certain circles sickulars don even figure this equation “for after all how know that two and two make four that the force gravity works that the past unchangeable both the past and the external world exist only the mind and the mind itself controllable – what then ” thus clearly see that the tribe the fundamental necessity well the ultimate goal human existence how this tribe defines itself called culture this culture turn can defined multiple factors race religion the communist manifesto the mein kampf nietzsche the god delusion course organized religion any tribe virtue the numerical superiority philosophical strength provides its members superior any number individuals thus dominates the latter through slaughter plunder therein lies the crux why the three great monotheistic faiths christianity islam judaism have destroyed virtually every single pagan faith the world save for india china paganism simply not robust enough ideology effectively bind people together too individualistic offers too many choices has too many freedoms don mistake freedom for the lack oppression murdering babies though that might been pure roman anti carthiginian propaganda burning widows which was the british digging nearly extinct traditions anti hindu propaganda are oppression but they not connote lack freedom the mere allowing choice within one spiritual thus cultural fabric paganism weakens the tribe thus paves the way for its own demise then why did india china survive the answer simple what the biggest factor that sets india china apart from the world and thus our hordes have given these two civilizations the immortality not even eternal egypt mighty rome could aspire like dragons outfought our pagan foes like monkeys cheated the mongol tumens like rats out bred our civilized monotheist oppressors thus survived but this state affairs could never continued for ever fertility rates fall schools open teach new lies place old ones people their eternal search for suffering hanker after new more horrifying tortures what people forget that leaving their religion they are effectively abandoning their own culture thus the very basis human civilization true they gain better softer society society more amenable individualistic bliss but such state affairs can only temporary before such hedonistic loosely bound members are swept away hard unthinking orthodoxy hindus long protected from the depredations islam christianity their vast population multifarious ethnic divisions warlike nature the early 1900s were open such culturalization thanks several events not under this answer purview thus was evident any well read indian the early 1900s that india concept was doomed extinction all said and done india hindu concept created hindus populated hindus defined hindus don give that secular nonsense hinduism like all indo european faiths does not correlate morality with divinity and thus shows tolerance for other religions unknown any faith currently existing earth yes even buddhism christians would got with their belief mythical jerusalem muslims would gone praying arab stone but india india are neither israel arabia and thus was born hindutva racial pride for made race one believed cultural pride for non existent culture land with

notice how all the evidence are from indian sources often talking about indians explaining what happened these are sources which have reason lie just pakistani would have reason lie about their version there dearth creditble non indian and non pakistani sources who share the same narrative events india sure you can claim that because they all hate india but think there another explanation,0
the doubts are not regarding whether the attacks happemed but whether they were successful has conveniently selected articles which say the attacks were successful most these are govt agencies and they will say whatever the govt wants ridiculous believe 250 terrorists were killed without any evidence but then the whole thing getting votes and nothing more btw the audio clip which says the attack happened also says one was killed but that part ignored because doesn suit the narrative,1
haha this sub has gone the dogs joined because wanted make fun self loathing indians but just like india this sub has started pandering particular political thought the country this country anywhere really people attack politics politicians they don like exaggeratedly nothing new will this sub accept statements like saal kuchh nahi hua maa chudi pari thi for see this statement the same spirit the can regarded self loathing can see the future this sub the elections are coming and shit people say during elections will just post those shits but pandering particular party,1

think this true,1
have unfortunately come long way away from the democracy its truest sense democracy has been reduced electoral dog fight where the party with better resources power money clout etc have significant advantage there lot circumstantial and hearsay evidence indicate that all the major parties power are cahoots for instance tasmac the govt run liquor shops said have only major distributors who belong dmk and admk and the same goes for illegal sand mining where the mafia has deep connections with both dmk and admk what surprises that how people don fail even consider for moment and even those who consider don take seriously the uneducated among them continue vote caste lines while the educated continue vote stability and experience and keep giving the same parties another chance even taking turns what this has done that almost impossible for new political outfit compete electoral politics with access money power and media like the main stream parties what happened delhi with aap was historic and needs happen frequently across that can away with this oligarchy that currently place,0
that really welcome post obviously congress gave birth bjp congress has other agenda politics but removing bjp matter what the cost the same goes with bjp father was cpwd and charge maintenance parliamentary building infrastructure was extremely surprised looking parliament canteen where two politicians different parties fighting lok sabha would enjoying their subsidised meals over civil discussion lot congress and bjp are good friends during childhood used believe undertaker and kane were really brothers and now turned bloodthirsty enemies growing realised wwe staged after growing more realised even parliament staged and this not just india this global phenomenon democracy has become cartel like business arrangement now politicians have cracked long ago,1
sab mile hue hai jokes apart heard rumour which rife the political circles that congress intentionally putting shitshow and refusing share seats with allies even states where weak because desperately wants rahulbaba become 2024 after anti incumbency factor against bjp kicks knows that this year makes deals with allies and somehow the upa manages get comfortable number seats enough form coalition government allies like cbn mamta mayawati kejri and others will not let rahulbaba become hence way conceding defeat with asshole planning way are fucked with bjp without bjp with absolute gutter assholes the helm the two biggest parties,0
look their business interests joint foreign trips are another data point even the first level leades fight the second level leaders have common interests mostly financing,1

mostly true the left and the right are like the yin and yang they are dependant each other justify their existence the sins one side result the rise the other and vice versa for not actually punishing the culprits that political tactic you punish your opponent you create martyr and kill issue which you could have milked for ages,1

yes this the real enlightenment one should get when she observe the pattern neutral entity they are all cahoots and matter who wins they only work for the population the country selected few the real dynasty india the people who represent our gdp hence every party fond judging their performance through gdp they work hard for the they automatically improve the gdp and like fools celebrate such news and keep living our illusion that have the real power change the country but the real question one should ask the gdp has increased many points percentage has life improved similar trend and the answer then you friend are part the illusion they all want believe,1

the problem that people think individuals groups politicians are corrupt that not true the entire system itself corrupt india there system that incentivises corruption one politician can actually succeed ever working honestly bureaucrat can survive working honestly there are built failures with the constitution and set the government itself this can traced even into civil society with brahmanical supremacy whereby every other group that wants have say society needs resort immoral means you can stand your local upper caste bully without money and you can make money unless you stand the upper caste bully you have resort immoral means get money when you that you have resort more than one thing which gives rise crime and criminality which basically poisons entire society when you talk about collusion between people you are probably right but most done unwittingly last resort india will never thrive until fixes these ingrained and inbuilt problems its society,1

lot people here are talking about the case let clarify few things there were two judgments that were written justice saini special judge cbi for the matter one was concerning raja and the other the directors loop essar telecom company with respect raja there was definitely arbitrariness with respect how the spectrum licenses were given out multiple advisory the internal staff and the telecom regulatory authority were ignored 2012 the supreme court agreed and canceled all the allotted licences that extent raja complicit but that can just written off saying that first there was explicit law that bars the telecom minister from not doing second raja can very well incompetent minister but that not crime constitute crime one has show any qui pro quo for what had done the second part extremely hard prove didn really for himself but for his party donations which are governed separate laws that gives favorable anonymity even though has been led off the hook special judge has more with the nature the crime than the innocence the criminal shall refrain from commenting the second judgment for now,1
congress ruled only for years not way win the argument mate clearly can not pass comment their competence till give them the remaining years lot the people know and realise the cons voting for modi sad state affairs that have choose the lesser the two evils most your arguments make complete sense vacuume unfortunately someone has become the try and make the best what got usual,1

have talked many muslims over period time and all them agree that the maulvis religious leader are the ones behind encouraging fundamentalism while most the muslims don care much same the case with hindus majority hindus don have real problem with muslims its just that religious and political leaders both sides keep harping whatever issue they can find citizens have see through and vote appropriately,1
all major political parties have used religion favor their agenda question about that bjp just too good mostly because their history rss won vote for bjp since they are hell bent destroying the cultural fabric india which has been present for 100s years they can guarantee safety their citizens muslims are citizens right what the point governance anyways also one question food for thought muslims have been living this country for over 1000 years now they have every right claim india their native land anybody who believes that muslims will leave india and pakistan has basically given all reason once wake and understand the above reality there only one option have vote for politics which doesn capitalize this divide and actively works cement for peace and harmony sadly have yet see such party india edit congress was good either but atleast congress government muslims didn enter hindu houses filmsy pretexts and beat entire family,1

the god war universe yes they would because they are all descendants odin and valhalla odins great hall and valhalla for the dead who died battle which they all did,1
classic norse mythology was killed his brother after made invincible his mother from everything except mistletoe was seen way kill him loli offered his blind brother dart made and died and went hel because will have died battle the god war timeline maybe all those who fall battle valhalla those that die dishinorably sickness old age ect hel,0

people questioning the timing announcement posturing should remember how world locked out nsg india nuclear programme can trace its origins march 1944 and its three stage efforts technology were openly advocating and working the weapons program 1964 bhabha was aggressively lobbying for nuclear weapons and made several speeches indian radio 1964 bhabha told the indian public via indian radio that such nuclear weapons are remarkably cheap and supported his arguments referring the economical cost american nuclear testing program plowshare had the tech prowess make work but our first test was done 1974 took years even after having everything ready make the announcement the nsg was founded response our tests may 1974 and first met november 1975 was created keep india out world nuclear power order they purposly made the distinction between members nws nuclear weapon states ratifers russia acceders china france and nnws non nuclear weapon states and kept 1st jan 1967 date apply this criteria china nuclear weapons tests took place 1964 and its first hydrogen bomb test occurred 1967 now china member nsg and blocking from getting the membership had conducted our tests before1st jan 1967 could have joined the nsg nws because decided wait and not announce our capabilities now have run behind nsg grant waivers and accept our membership but they want sign nnws nnws have agree let developing acquiring nuclear weapons all this because didn the test soon enough didn announce our capabilities what tomorrow these countries create another club and stop from going moon mars what they block creation anti sat weapons this why have make big announcement for our mars moon mission anti sat weapons have tell the world were here first,1
target was small dummy satellite launched isro leo orbit around 300kms think the missile used the same interceptor developed drdo for bmd program india gets affirm both its asat and bmd capability through this test although other exo atmospheric interceptor tests have been carried out,0

doesn really relate the issue but man the way indian politicians and indians general talk about stuff like this full indigenous look tourette,1
second thought think the address was the right thing this great defence achievement the level pokhran,1
india has entered its name elite space power anti satellite weapon sat successfully targeted live satellite low earth orbit mission shakti operation was difficult target achieve which was completed successfully within three minutes launch india has registered herself space power today till now only russia and china have achieved this now india the 4th country achieve this feat today have enough satellites that are contributing various segments such agriculture disaster management communication weather navigation etc assure the world community that our new prowess not against anyone,1

and she forgets the work done her constituency saala hum chutiya hai inhe banate hai aur don know inse sawal puchne main fat kyon jaati hai,1
having anti satellite deterrence equal having gained nuclear power status this why modi announced also russia never destroyed satellite orbit technically are 3rd anti satellite missile very complex should proud,1
think was entirely appropriate for the address this remember the world also watching and this entirely new warfare capability that india has acquired nothing less than when india went nuclear remember when china did this for the first time and the entire world reacted very negatively the important part was not announcing that the operation took place maybe drdo iaf they handle this could done the important part was announcing the posture that the weapons will used for peaceful purposes and technological advancement only that the policy position that the world interested and like the first use policy for nukes only the should announce for credible,1
make mistake this big pokhran space the new frontier and india has come age even before any other european countries,1

pros passport came less than days improved cleanliness although isn still completely clean following night time rules partying any occasion after quite few colleagues college mates have started being more proud their roots and culture rather than being full blown western don know because modi cons still tax benefits from the government for father who pays his taxes and gst fact the department lost case against father the court yet hasn paid him the amount directed the judgement censorship sites like reddit etc,1
personally not sure,0
why announcing new missile,1
believe baldur helheim now per the mythology suppose magni and modi would there too god war obviously not following the mythology completely though,1
regarding what you said about freya was thinking about this while ago since odin took away her warrior spirit she can technically die battle maybe her head impossible for her reunite with her son,0
not sure what most you are confused with baldur died trying kill his mother \ which can considered battle noble act\ and she accepted hel doubt and that one the reasons freya threatens destroy kratos and parade his body all the realms magni the other hand died fighting which means \ probably\ went valhalla modi died cowards death fled the battle twice practically signed for eternity hel,0

edit fsm cthulhu comments are the mark just thought that the middle class will nto see easily for most the middle class the effects will not show easily except perhaps inflation being tamed cleanliness going infrastructure getting better etc modi coming power has improved india negotiating power hugely this has resulted and will result lot benefits that will percolate down everyone,1

not only about who did about who the victims were mali nigeria kenya south sudan liberia who cares see vice videos these places they are saddening yet doesn grab much attention the same line mumbai attack didn garner same attention paris attacks 3rd world countries and thier lives matter less that how shouldn that way but more gdp more valuable the life resident all the attention palestine gets kashogi killing got yemen war made little news this also one the factor who did also has some weight for instance rohingya crisis got all the outrage against myanmar which small state with little value terms business compared uygher detention speaking against china gotta hurt your wallet guess,1
sure the timing could political but one cannot deny the fact that the test was performed during the present government india military might definitely increasing and everyone should proud,1
now please shoot down the satellites beaming our partisan news media khtanxbai,0
let’ put context before becomes all about how modiji the magician can work wonders from wikipedia televised press briefing during the 97th indian science congress 2010 thiruvananthapuram the defence research and development organisation director general rupesh announced that india was developing the necessary technology that could combined produce weapon destroy enemy satellites orbit,0
when saw the announcement did not get the value the message had initially but now kind get kudos the team but have small question not against anyone don make judgements especially political grounds and try give answer you know why didn the head drdo isro make this announcement public wont the nation youth kids get the person team who was actually behind this important feat,1
itt instead being proud will portray hatred for modi,1
does this mean can shoot down pakistani satellite when terror attack happens deterrent,0
technologically this puts into the super elite ranking especially with missile design but that wasn something were really bad kudos the drdo really now let watch the bjp make into something that they did when the reality that asat development has been going for long time,0
orgasmic material for bhakts and for too this really huge,1
better then our australian space program which nonexistent haven even sent jar vegemite there yet,1
space the one place that absolutely should not weaponised unequivocally condemn every single nation including own country which has developed technology and capabilities this nature space belongs mankind large and not one few nations and nothing should done impede united mankind space weaponising does exactly that besides using weapons destroy things space results the creation additional space debris which with time will only grow into bigger problem and perhaps make difficult even enter leave the planet,1

ispr isn doing good job pakistani people were resilient without the ispr too ispr was good you wouldn know what the ispr was,1
the point where okay with corrupt govt long its not trying actively destroy the democracy freedom speech and the moral fabric our nation this how low has become,0
one wants get into politics start political party that fairly progressive and economically sane then what the point complaining with congress you get corruption without the rss element with bjp you get corruption with the rss element pick your poison even you start such party india doesn have large enough middle class for social democratic parties thrive for votes you are left pander the billionaire and millionaire class the poor the goons and bhakts the latter two outnumber everyone this sub with left leaning liberal values and the billionaire and millionaire class are just too powerful thanks their money there political party fighting for the people politician fighting for the betterment the country what you want some moral consolation you cast your vote you get nothing either you pick your poison don participate matter things will remain the same way they are become worse the decades come,1
same boat you will vote for the best candidate available even she independent spend hour understand each your candidate and decide not vote for nota,1
when indira gandhi became one was saying she dynastic because she had leadership skills but now other way even start calling bjp dynastic will not stick till senior positions inside bjp govt filled dynasts,1
good stats but they still get some brownie points for their top tier not being dynastic some degree dynasticism hard get rid connected moms and dads give legs their kids and all but dynasticism the top lot more problematic normally something like sure let give sharmaji kid ticket but better win with dynastic control like sharmaji kid has become the party chairperson matter what plenty parties with this problem across the spectrum rjd sad mns and good old inc course for example even the current setup way amit shah kid gets ticket after losing two national elections,1
although agree there are similar gandhi family has major power matter who elected from congress bjp there one single family constantly posing unquestionable power for generations,0
try doing some research the candidates who are contesting from where you vote vote their merit not for against party only way make sure get competent leadership not being blindsided the big names random schemes,1
bjp opposing the gandhi dynasty inc then why are they allowing varun gandhi from sultanpur and maneka gandhi from aonla union cabinet minister thier own party,1
congress like thieves who sneak into your house night while you are away vacation bjp like dacoits who threaten and tie you broad daylight while everyone home,1

some points gathered since 1999 the congress has had dynastic members parliament elected the lok sabha with the bjp not far behind with the 15th lok sabha beginning 2009 was the most ‘dynastic’ term yet comprising mps with family ties politicians percent the total lower house the number successful independent candidates lok sabha elections has fallen from peak 1957 more than three 2014 symptom the rising costs contesting elections though famously the state where all four generations the nehru gandhi family have held their constituencies the bjp has had the highest number dynasts power percent the longest serving dynasts have inherited their seat parliament whether long standing political dynasties have negative impact constituency hard determine,1
from the regional parties hold the sway never voted for dmk and wont future also reason being lawlessness extreme corruption family politics and main reason lived through the electricity scarcity years 2010 2011 the suffering experienced chennai due heat and humidity during those times made dmk hater the core have been neutral towards admk steadfastly voted nota after 2011 because admk became welfare party with high levels corruption after years this election may vote for admk bjp decision struggling because was planning for nota but recent announcements such basic pay poor reservation for women have shaken belief have seen the effects welfare people its like drug which can never taken away from budget surplus years ago because its extreme welfare heavy debt also upa rule was worst from coal cwg coal scams policy paralysis was dark period people also forget the npa growth and the high inflation from upa rule think congress present leaders dont have any good plans for the growth the country their main plank has been farm loan waivers and ubi schemes bjp has been arrogant for the last years think they get another chance mostly will coalition government they cant make stupid decisions like demonetization also the communal jibes will die down because coalition government you are answerable many parties with minority interests,1
vote for the local good candidate always all elect only good people parliament they will figure out way run the country decently for years you really hate party then vote for the local parties independents but not drop the good candidate filter voting get winning vote against democracy exactly gambling casino not your personal ego stake the future your constituency perfectly fine vote for independents who have good qualifications there are many instances independents doing good work where decades rule big parties have failed,1

not bad idea start from your local candidates even your guy loses you would not have wasted your vote but exercised your democratic rights truthfully and honestly good candidate even when she loses step forward than simply voting for lesser evil over greater evil least this how looking,0
simple your constituency and check who are the other candidates pretty sure there are candidates who are worthy and ready good work for one class mate has turned into politician years back spends days farms with farmers working with them trying understand their problems and then pitching the issues with local authorities but hardly got votes,1
best thing vote for the party which good according your locality the same guy gets appointed then the main party doesn matter,1
think matter who gets elected our duty citizens hold them responsible for their actions and how effects modi himself could bigot but your ’ answerable you and you alone same goes for any other guy think lately around the world democracy being equated majoritarianism and people demarcate themselves according their political ideologies democracy matter who gets elected once elected ’ your representative make sure regardless who gets the seat every single voice heard and one left behind,0

ispr did relay information timely manner but they already had the massive leverage provided them paf ’ easy win the information war when there verifiable proof that corroborates your side the story ispr wasn’ successful when india made claims about their previous “surgical strike” despite them not providing any tangible proof they were able sell that false narrative the world ispr extremely behind the times when comes information warfare this was more own goal rather than exemplary display competency will say however that the way all arms the pakistani state worked tandem take militarily advantageous position and turned into diplomatic push was quite heartening see after decades there finally some synergy happening between civil and military institutions and the results are already quite visible,1

don think all legitimate raise congress lack political courage over the sabarimala issue the level hindutva that actually quite ridiculous was political calculation the bjp affinity for hindutva not political ideological reservation the most political and least meaningful issues affects only government jobs which make what percentage the jobs economy again for gifts yeah that quite pathetic and almost every single party the country does some way the other but neither loan waivers nor minimum income fall into that category those are both schemes with legitimate policy arguments behind them the congress itself admits that farm loan waivers are bad idea not sustainable solution they pitching some sort economic band aid emergency relief the people badly affected the current government anti poor policies and much they try dress populist jumlas the findamental basis modinomics good old right wing economics which the same around the world trickle down economy which well known not work and end widening the wealth gap the basic minimum income actually not novel idea there are countries where this already happens and actually quite effective but country our size has tried yet and probably less effective than hope but policy the right direction yes every alternative has flaws but when one the two major players seems have maleficent agenda lesser the two evils becomes very understated way describing the difference between the two sides isn small ideologically inclined one party isn farfetched fear radical abrogation the most basic fundamental values the idea india,1

here the thing about meritocracy when you systematically subdue particular section society creating multiple hurdles their socio educational advancement you are rewarded with less competition for the sought after jobs and seats educational institutes since the said sections society are longer able compete against you this like breaking the legs your opponent before the race that you can later win the race merit what affirmative action does removes the disability imposed that particular section society reserving fair share seats for example what proportion seats would have been occupied scs who constitute the population had they not been treated like dirt for thousands years yes exactly what proportion would have been occupied women had they been treated like actual human beings with actual brains exactly before you start guessing let tell you general category male and support not but seats for women both jobs education and parliament assemblies real meritocracy everyone should able compete without the disabilities imposed them society compared the privileged sections when compete for job with others don want take seat which would have otherwise gone woman but got that seat just because society thinks men are more meritorious the reservation based economic criteria sure dubious almost entire india earns less than 8lpa 8lpa poor then mukesh ambani middle class,1

how bjp creating new jobs not releasing employment statistics least congress released necessary statistics knew were screwed and could take steps solve bjp lying the nation how can you solve problem the government refuses admit its there afraid this kind shit will become normal politics now matter who forms the next govt the only good thing about congress that people will happily criticize them and there none that our god least congress can pressured repair stupid corrupt policies but bjp has damaged many our institutions congress will take full advantage the corrupt shortcuts bjp has created the difference both are bad but congress can pressured and that gives them more accountability the public,0
liberal virtue signaling cute,1
both are equally corrupt both are corrupt whether equal not will find out later the bjp hasn crippled cag remember the congress only lost hold power when things got bad results decades bad policies the 90s until they had choice the bjp even though fucked majorly with monetary decisions like demonetization even though forgive but this pisses off don understand how you can just shrug something like that with even though how would you feel like went even though hitler was mass murderer revitalized the german economy there even though here punished the congress for scams then bjp needs punished for demonetization for demonetization was like being midst earthquake someone was pulling the ground from underneath feet doesn matter what modi says does say lot things and the opposite them all time his actions are more honest was clear that the man party that went ahead with demonetization does not have the interest middle class heart bjp not the party the middle class not buying that bullshit after demonetization does seem trying best bring investment and create jobs though all that happening major indian companies being aggressively taken over ebay walmart and the like yes and the problem while sells business friendly friendly towards certain businesses cough ambani adani while others get fucked over willing bet mukesh ambani involved shady deals just like his brother anil vijay mallya but the ones who have seen their fortunes dwindle are those who didn side with modi amit and the people hate corruption but forget private business are involved too collusion not mention are experiencing the worst rate unemployment the nation the moment with lot youths with degrees from colleges that didn teach them much but too lot money from them settling for low paying jobs this regime despite all marketing almost bad congress for startups smes feel like the have dialed back the 80s resentment against the system amitabh bacchan angry young man persona after the optimism the 90s see one difference between bjp and congress shameless the people congress pretend people with good intentions while people from bjp are openly shameless about their bad intentions the political culture whole has gone drown the drain lynchings used happen before but now organized used suspect that media were paid put spin news interview least pretended that they were unbiased but now overt shameless you can walk away from the debates have turned into big boss come back hour later not surprised even predict what being said repeat stuff don about you but blame the bjp recommend you listen the seen and the unseen from ivm podcast had lot similar misconceptions about the bjp before helped think more depth about stuff than cut paste photoshop social media can supporters either party sway their way don support either party but voting against bjp because want send message even though just one lad the establishment that they not getting away with pulling something like demonetization whichever way you vote stay vigilant get involved activism hold you elected representative accountable not talking about sharing posts social media mean start sending your responses bills the ministers tweet them you oppose something the legislation for tweeting minister opposing provision privacy bill train you gun their asses make them know you there that you looking them make them feel uncomfortable please don waste your time holding them accountable for shit they say stick strictly their business laws expenditure and ignore the trolls swear works the moment you start asking question about their work ignore all attempts from trolls distract you congress did this rahul said that they sort give because they don have proper response,0

after reading the all top comments wish bjp will loose the elections but ground reality different whole friend circle relatives and people around are modi fans what think modi will come into power but not with absolute majority,1
actually did any party say that don think what happened was that bjp and modi bombast was over instant from chest thumping and bravado was sheepishness and silence they probably thought other parties were asking when will abhinandan return the question always there the air one has ask the embarrassment that makes them feel like the question was asked next even were asked big deal there are different routes patriotism the current government fucking the country that patriotic sentiment whether the government power upa nda bjp definitely subscribed when they were opposition none this really matters bjp and its fans modi and his fans know its all about scoring goals absolutely does not matter them whether its right wrong whether its factual incorrect whether there are other interpretations statement which should given value etc after all those are liberal sentiments and values for the right these are just tools objective,0
don you think will again win this elections maybe very small margin look social media has scores blind supporters have highly educated the students from elite colleges friends telling that dictatorship under modi better for india these people have shown love for hitler and hate for ghandhi openly justification there immense hate against minorities the name minority appeasement social media circles fake news being prominent ones although the people with phones and access social media won decide our future but the poorer sections society especially rural will the most probable outcome will inc winning most south maharashtra going bjp they work good here most central states where bjp recently lost may still north east swing with the nrc bengal will turn out bjp the atrocities done mamta the name secularism further north will also bjp delhi can aap for the developments have heard maybe seen punjab haryana too feel sad for country for where heading was the same country ancestors fought for side side with every honourable indian against the oppressive rule only end like this hands people who were and are busy plotting terrorism murder back then,1

the link the article shared says modi himself enlightened the senior journalist that this practice started with lal bahadur shastri fact goes say vajpayee ensured his travel itinerary accommodated journalists’ work hours why this smeared upa and what you mean ‘well known’ closely follow political news but have never heard the fact that barkha dutt’ baggage allowance went from 200 kgs whatever unless its not fact not arguing against what modi has done which commendable but against this blatant name shaming without any proof,0
left mighty pissed prakash karat has made angry statements basically saying that congress isn fighting bjp but the left this elections,0
that why think voting for nota makes sense and would promote the problem with majority the people that they think that voting otherwise waste because modi gonna win anyway but that not voting about not betting about who will win more about expressing opinion and which direction want india move sure modi will probably win even nota gets majority but least can express concerns and opinions against racism casteism bigotry and rss,1

lololol tushar and vellapilly are needed for the nda because the bjp has failed develop much clout among the ezhavas who are the states population the rss and aikyavedi have made inroads but not enough numbers there even every single kerala voted bjp they still getting only kerala hindu votes for the bjp have any hope gaining power either needs the influential upper caste nasrani votes all those mallu christians who are bjp good chunk obc dalit votes given the past dalits kerala are much less likely vote bjp that leaves the ezhavas who are considerably less backward than they used and many have strong religious ferver most past bjp kerala strategies have been attempts get either those communities switch sides atleast chunk those votes,1
such beautiful opening genuine but magical like watched lotr and harry potter and all that stuff and geeked out over magic but this was actual magic talking about the elements and invoking something still gets after some years opens with the elements and pithy description the deity find that worth considering that the deity described terms self existing equanimity this speaks the deity the practice but also the nature deities themselves,1

dude vote per your choice but just make sure ldf loses completely this left menace has eradicated from india this election left must loose their national party status,1
namaskaram ente bhaarya malayali aanu agree with everything you’ said bjp kerala hopeless because the state leadership believe they put sreedharan pillai because was rather neutral face not part any faction factionalism has ruined bjp kerala the current faces the state unit surendran probably the most deserving and has done the most see even congress and cpm folks saying positive things about him kummanam simple guy and hard working but has too much connect with the rss and the hindu orgs rss wants him the party face overall think bjp ought get its marketing right kerala sabarimala gave good platform but taking local issues appealing nris building the development image like how they’ done karnataka and raising interesting faces will bring results also modi never compared kerala somalia said that kerala’ tribals have high imr higher than india’ average his statement was twisted and misinterpreted the left,1
hear you won tell you who vote but remember you not just voting for your constituency you are also voting national level decide for yourself who can affect the most change,1
honest people won able stay alive hostile state kerela sure you are well aware the political killings happening around the state only when regime changes some order can restored and candidates with better background will encouraged there only much party trying rise can manage currently its survival,1
lol what does cong know about economy its was serial scammer whose son also scammer and its rbi governor allowed lakh crores worth npa build meanwhile imf worldbank state india amongst the fastest growing economies gets good grades from economists for years reforms narendra modi been good for business cong had the vision formulate indian bankruptcy code there wouldnt have been many npas and defaults but cong had created npa the cases would decided who bribes chiddu more and not nclt nclat,1
know bjp shitty the south and kerala hard for the good and useful people they are not left winged even survive have hopes tejasvi surya bangalore but still but don know how turn out even bjp turns successful one southern state there will hope other states accepting,1
thanks for sharing this from and here too other options are bad but bjp candidates too are equally bad idk what with the show off and power complex netas untill they misbehave with administrative officers police officers like their ego not satisfied all father appreciates modi but would hate give vote any bjp mps here and same with other party candidates why fucking difficult little more polite anyways going vote for bjp,0
surprised kummanam isn doing much talking should talk about the tvm light metro project which has been stalled for many years now,1
same here they have given ticket bullshit candidate here chhattisgarh raipur they have chosen sunil soni mahasamund chuuni sahu and other bullshit people who can even speak well and have really bad past records only good candidate can see vijay baghel who remained loyal bjp after not giving him ticket 2014 both women candidates are good think vijaya baghel and either both women will win but bjp will lose rest the seats here its 3bjp congress,1
the point you make very valid bjp has dearth good candidates kerala and they haven had good presence there until now good leaders not come until the party has presence and the party does not have presence until good candidates fight for them its chicken and egg game you vote for them today the quality local leadership will improve time goes,1
focus more the state elections when comes your local rep,1
just look this article from 2016 and you will know why bjp has not learned thing choice bjp candidates upsets many supporters kerala 2016 now they are going repeat the same and lose then pikachu face,1
takes lot work build cadres and leaders state and kerala has been constantly ruled cong commies bjp has struggled make inroads both kerala and you cant expect good candidates arrive magically over night most parties build their fortes when they are power good candidates sometimes are rajya sabha members who showcase their work and then get elected based their work,1

yes they did the same delhi legislative elections twice and then the supporters act surprised when they didn win campaigning kiran bedi the 2013 elections harshwardhan won they replaced him with kiran bedi and she won seats,1
true words india needed this strong stand against terroristan atleast yrs ago this news was not circulated much but india started trade with pakistan after weeks think the main reason was modi didn wanted farmers and traders suffer because all the engagements between india and terroristan think after this election once bjp gets elected again one their targets will find alternate trading opportunities for those traders who supply pakistan and reduce the trade deficit with china,1
this the key point india far and beyond the terrorist camp next door not require them for our identity their entire identity their history and present endeavors are reflection what india doing,1

this seems stupid looks like congress more worried other parties occupying space than defeating bjp,0
ease doing business from 141 credit rating upgrade massive financial inclusion inflation well control currently below food inflation remarkably low though farmers suffer but many poor benefit farmers compensated guaranteed cash transfer monetary policy completely politicised creating mpc talking about strengthening institutions that haters love mention rbi holding record high forex reserves banker the poor inspired mudra scheme help pakoda sellers dream becoming haldirams and keventers and records show the loans are actually being taken not scheme paper fiscal deficit down considering slippage down from upa,1
’ just stupidity that people think contesting wayanad because scared losing amethi people amethi will vote gandhi family regardless the situation how backward ’ sad but that’ the reality for all the modi wave still won’ here with more than lakh votes the major reason contesting wayanad because trying consolidate the muslim christian votes wayanad one the rare muslim major constituencies india also helps that wayanad has the biggest share vote kerala ’ different the varanasi modi contesting varanasi and projecting representative hindus because contested holy hindu city the only question whether this will actually work,0
just fyi your have very little legislative powers due the the anti defection laws they will just serve the purpose deciding the executive,0

news agency doing article another news agencies article and the article itself not being news worthy how pathetic are these news agencies,0
the most basic point which people forget before beringing 2004 like retards that 1999 was not 2014 inc vote share was actually higher than bjp even 1999 bjp was much lower than what and they had won mere 180 seats 1999 2004 bjp had lost multiple state elections and failed expand their base states they lost elections maharashtra bihar and they were still not even contest karnataka west bengal the only major state elections that they won were gujarat and state elections rajasthan and chattisgarh the former was only because modi and godhra and the latter because anti incumbency finally paying off,0
the issue isn that congress will get those seats the issue that bjp won get near majority and the major beneficiaries will the regional parties congress can register meaningful gains only raj and guj best case maybe little haryana and they can get past 130 140 even the most favourable scenario worst case scenario for bjp losing seats bsp and another congress above mentioned states and meaningful gains eastern india,1
many more such factors all from 2009 2009 cong itself won seats partner rld won totalling seats they would lucky get this year that loss seats rajasthan was rout cong got seats bjp given how close the state elections were and this with incumbeny this year even optimistically they would lucky cross all seats that loss you said was seats digression why the crazy chuths keep voting cong this year telengana combined they might get seats assuming cbn allies with cong lax that loss seats assam they had lucky get this year that lost haryana they swept seats even assuming half that seats loss maha was another biggie along with ncp they won lucky get half again this year loss seats just these states alone result loss odd seats that they can win matter what and these are the upper predictions from the upa tally 262 knock off these and you get 190 best take power they will need another seats this means khichdi parties say very optimistically momta jihad bannerjee with another and they are still seats short maybe bjd coughs best luck with stability even choosing who will would shitshow and govt would collapse within year and these are all hyper optimistic projections realistically the upa would close maybe 120 seats the third front 200 odd and the rest going the nda,1
