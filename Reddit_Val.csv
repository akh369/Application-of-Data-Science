rajasthan isn close better than expected for bjp but not close,1
still can trs route telangana winning more seats than last time everybody underestimating kcr kcr national ambitions incoming tdp congress alliance breaking would not surprise,1
you win some you lose some and bjp the past has won lot doesn matter they lose few stars they still like states the pious bhagwa back friend and here stay cowabunga bitch,1
anti incumbency years madhya pradesh and chattisgarh opposition vasundara raje lead the wins congress those states with that too bjp gave tough fight madhya pradesh all these votes are due the opposition against the respective cms modi has little nothing with this has little effect the lok sabha elections there the fight between modi cong alliance the strength modi clear the way congress forming alliances this leads similar result what happened telangana trs mahakutami cong tdp others,0
congress never learns already fighting started for post rajasthan and and the leads aren’ even out fully bunch fucking clowns,0
vasundhra supervising evm counts seems weird that rajasthan being closely contested when noone seems have voted for the bjp,0
bhenchod yeh news channel waale kisi bhi sagey nahi hotey look that navika jump ship think the first time have heard her praise rahul gandhi,1
this guy from the election commission excusing the evm being taken away truck saying that just out few lakhs wtf smh edit tbf did seem pretty rational about very difficult micromanage 11m civil servants but the question does remain how deal with something like this afterwards,0
you can see that bjp doing better where 3rd party oth are not prominent they may not win but not complete clear majority yet for either party while rajasthan others are,0

singh deo already saying first thing that congress will pass chattisgarh sign the loan waiver fucking hell,0
pappu pass hua hai top nahin kiya aur campus nahi lag gayi,1
leads are narrowing only seat difference now down from hope congress gets majority their own otherwise governor will come into the picture and all know how that ends,1
now thinking that tdp should have just left congress fight alone telangana may the sentiments unholy alliance wouldn there and congress could have won few more seats,1
results super delayed more than hundred seats are below rounds according ndtv expect official results come much later the day,1
lol feel this bit like cricket match thread serious note looks like congress might end being able form government rajasthan their own the numbers have been stuck 100 101 for while now but think they might still want the support bsp and independents,1
rajasthan result more volatile across news channels,1

has bjp taken the lead wow,1
does anyone with more knowledge mizoram eli5 mnf,1
what does rujhano mean,0
the irony that the manusmirti wasn ever intended implementable full was one guy internally contradictory guidance that was contested its own time and isn the definitive text even according orthodox hindus with anything hinduism one several often contradictory and opposing schools thought other words isn the hindu equivalent sharia law though these right wing idiots with their desire for simplistic absolutist beliefs seem want make,0
lol that sadyogi face the thumbnail,1
serves this dipshit right just because his supporters believe ram rajya does not mean hindus want that over jobs and safety,1
talk about misplaced priorities,0
and don think will easy for bjp change that what they have started since 2016 giving false hopes vhp and bajrang dal support bjp elections false notion ram mandir vhp demands are not met they will work against bjp just like how they did delhi karnataka and now these states and previously the karyakartas are not just from bjp alone which less numbers compared vhp and bajrang dal and all other small groups who are waiting for ram mandir either ram mandir development card 2019 both won happen the same time that the ultimatum these groups are giving very recently,0
what with really going neck neck news channels have been contradicting about bjp loses then unarguably bjp will loose big time,0
109 109 right now,1
pardon wrong but won the actual results come around 3pm something after constituency something are given seats won know the final winner then how does this work,0
the very reason stopped supporting bjp from vikas they vaulted 180 degrees mandir vikas let alone priority not even their side dish converted since demo,1
remember with the gujarat elections the bjp was really ahead first then came back down pretty low which looked tough fight but then went back the bjp pretty easily wonder gonna like that gonna stay tough one and also there was update the eci website,1
trends far seemingly congress set for sweep rajasthan close lead for congress expected trs win telengana bjp close lead chattisgarh nothing mizoram,1
nifty rising and falling per bjp lead rajasthan this coincidence their relationship involved yes this due bjp being centre the image that its pro business,0

just here say fuck cow politics fuck ram politics fuck hindutva politics fuck zee news fuck republic fuck the prime minister and his murderous deputy thanks,0
seeing lot confusion about the concept trends wins and what they constitute try and explain short since early the morning the officials start counting votes from each evm don know how many they count from once but they need lots rounds count them all and meanwhile the votes that have already been counted are displayed which are known trends the trends show which party ahead others particular constituency which why more votes are counted the party with the most votes that constituency can change does lot times what are seeing this time news channels are the number seats each party has the highest number votes far these can change more votes are counted sooner later the officials will done with all the rounds constituencies and then news channels will also show how many seats each party has won the number won seats which determine whether party has majority assembly not and then further horse trading after results are out course why they show trends they don matter the end not entirely sure either think combination trying keep transparency while counting votes not sure about this particular and news channels having half day broadcasting material that the political equivalent badminton match where the viewer glued see the shuttlecock jump from one court another you have any questions glad answer able,1
chhattisgarh results were surprising didn expect such huge margin,1
bjp star campaigner adityanath bisht did more rallies than modi and shah unsurprisingly bjp losing all those places guess who the new rahul gandhi indian politics okbye,1
ndtv doing real good job right now whoever wins assembly elections chhattisgarh madhya pradesh and rajasthan tends well the general election there and bjp won almost all the seats those states the last general election this could bode badly for bjp 2019 but this was pre modi who knows,1

rahul gandhi says has learnt lot from 2014 has learnt humility india great country and you have listen the people this country and what they want narendra modi has taught this lesson was given huge mandate but then didn utilise properly and stopped listening the people the asset india are people,1
still feel indian politics needs evolve right now the only reason cong getting votes because farmers plight bjp won the election because people being fed the upa2 corruption this what bugging the opposition just riding the blunders the previous govt not because they have strong political manifesto mandate and this cycle needs stop need good leaders who genuinely can start working the grass root level hope congress learns from their stupidity before and start working towards progressive india ’ tired this hindu muslim ram mandir and city renaming bullshit rather have real issues being sorted like fixing the goddamn economy helping the farmers creating more jobs,1
look chhatisgarh almost all exit polls and news coverage predicted another term for the bjp there however the entire tribal belt has voted for the congress and even the central hindu regions are mostly blue easy guess the reasons behind the former aadhar but what caused the traditional vote base the bjp turn against them economic concerns the controversy,0
tamil nadu state bjp president tamilisai legit called these results this winning defeat whatever the fuck that,1

congress getting clear majority and rajasthan according latest counting this huge,1
slowly those hung assemblies are turning into full majority for congress bjp was drenched power knock knock,1
the battle won but the war far from over the close calls rajasthan and seem suggest that the votes were cast opposition the bjp more than they wee favour the congress this could mean any number things but was betting man put money bjp not doubling down the hinduvta rhetoric and building the temple something they will focus now leading the general elections the ultimate goal for the opposition feel hasn changed they should seek cripple the bjp because there are far too many people who shame their degrees supporting bigots the country bjp shackled coilation would easier manage the future remains uncertain,1

two contradictory thoughts the victory and may not extend election and had around years bjp raj that tremendous anti incumbency factor but modi has run ruin only for years the anti incumbency factor may not huge and some people who have voted inc may give him benefit doubt this theory not applicable since they usually gets fed years the other hand the anti modi bjp feeling may finally consolidate after this elections section people like float wave modi wave mandir wave any wave till now they were floating modi wave since bjp got big zero today they might come realize the wave now over inc may consolidate these voters their advantage with careful strategy and planning inc may turn this anti modi bjp storm into tsunami they have convince that modi wave over and the issues common people which more important than the personality battle between modi and rahul gandhi,1

nota most popular chhattisgarh could have swayed results madhya pradesh the results assembly elections five states chhattisgarh madhya pradesh rajasthan mizoram and telangana showed nota registering around lakh votes nota was popular among voters the state that had more votes than seven parties which included ncp and cpi however terms votes nota polled the highest madhya pradesh with 342 votes per cent total vote share with the vote share split evenly between the congress and bjp the votes that went towards nota may have tilted the scales favour either the two parties,1
the important thing note here common public not against any party leader are actually fed this mandir masjid issue and arrogance current his government took good initiative and decision but failed make consensus between opposition common public institution another thing congress came out from image soft feeling minorities pro muslim not against any religion community but why special preference anyone who poor poor despite following any religion every marginalises section society needs help another issue farm distress and loan waiver loan waiver not the solution have seen farmers they all grow the same type crops which causes excessive production and without proper infrastrure they can store for long time right now small farmer can even get production cost government focuses just one year out five build public cold storage and other storage facilities things will change they can also follow kcr schemes telangana source aspx last people the middle class better not say anything wish bank also give home loan waiver least one emi,0
people praising rahul for reason and they will disappointed soon rajasthan bjp and congress have been coming power alternatively for decades the result was expected surprisingly bjp voteshare was almost the same congress madhya pradesh bjp was facing years anti incumbency and yet got more voteshare than congress the result could have gone either way chhattisgarh again bjp was facing years anti incumbency and greatly benefited congress,1

great shot next time though please straighten that horizon,1
they say atreus’ eyes glow gold summons the serpent stop thamur though don’ know that’ true not and much love this game don’ think can run through again just for that scene,1
yeah found the watched the final boss fight again youtube and yup they sure did,1
very nice and enough detailed explanation for anyone who completed the game and wants summary this post should stickied,1
according the role the one who loses one arm tyr fenrir bites his arm off although kratos losing one arm and have berserk like implant would good story element,1
detail you’ got wrong kratos didn’ midgard leave his past behind fenrir skoll and hati showed and dragged him there seemingly the wolves took action start ragnarok early edit see someone else had already pointed this out sorry,0
right that the misdirection the devs were talking about isn until you beat the game that you realize was looking for faye not kratos they even have the runewall fragment from the end the game hidden during the first boss fight with baldur have find the dev stream pretty cool seeing them talk about all the things they hid the first mins that pretty much spell out the whole game,1
great summary one thing really missed how the hell jotunheim devastated and all the giants are dead was pretty sure odin found way there,1
kratos apparently didn’ come midgard his own but skol and haati were sent odin bring kratos there the novelization according many posts ’ seen this sub,1
don think there evidence odin didnt tell him who was looking for just never says out loud kratos bit stretch say anything else behind that just because doesn say otherwise besides that all looks accurate,1
deceased nordic god war tyr thought tyr was chained odin and thor mural could alive baldur attempts bring atreus asgard beleive wants asgard get someone able kill kratos,1
thank you much maybe wrong but think baldur want learn how break the spell went kratos thinking was giant thank you again,0
nice thank you for this,1
great write but always assumed that when baldur died the long winter came and finally felt snow didn’ summon was just amazed the feeling cold snow,1
great summary thank you very much for this having played spider man and rdr2 the meantime almost forgot how truly amazing this world and story are favourite game far this generation and any other for that matter,1
like what you have here but can’ correct simply because you failed mention tyr all and throughout the game ’ made very apparent that whatever the “big picture” tyr played major role setting,0
very nice read thanks for summarizing this great game lore,1
this post absolutely amazing man,1
thank you very much just completed the story and this was very nice read thanks again well done,1
\ knowing now that odin after them kratos and atreus begin their journey along the way they meet freya who hides her identity from them she gives them both runic which apparently imo hides them from odin this probably tracking rune that why she found them the black breath,0
man now want play again  great post man,1
morbidly excited for kratos death,1
this great,1
this awesome loved the start,1
wonder how much this because they couldn fullfill the ram mandir promise the promise rehabilite kashmiri pandits the promise black money form swiss banks the promise massive development new cities which would create abundant jobs,1
wise extrapolate anything from such limited data were these constituencies likely vote for party were politicians and trying win lost cause seats swing seats just preaching the choir did they increase their vote share did win more votes less than last time after campaigned there regardless outcome these headlines just further build the politics personality narrative and are pretty much useless imo but just mildly interested politics what know,1
these type figures don tell you anything the party loses the states and someone campaigns all the closest districts then they will lose 100 the constituencies but doesn mean they lost because one person correlation not causation,0
hahahahaha love how the tables have turned,1
taklu has better ratio than modi,1
don mean bummer but wouldn have campaigned more swing constituencies,1
modi had spent much time governing does campaigning then bjp would have performed better,1
but but arnab said bjp was losing rajasthan badly and modi last minute campaign helped bjp give tough fight,0
ghar shadi hai paise nehi hai hahaha still searching where the fun the sentence,1
mitron modiji responsible take fix rbi cbi supreme court and also travel the world meet with any autocrat ready meet him where did have the time campaign,1
how did they win seats where kaka campaigned telangana did campaign 200 seats,1
laugh people laugh,1
one question about baldur believing kratos giant assumed baldur’ opening statement about ‘your kind was supposed much smarter enlightened’ was referring greeks odin knew about the greek pantheon and mimir least knew the death the pantheon odin was also least aware laufey and she was renowned figure opposing odin when baldur saw the second bed figured took sign was harboring her assume least knew her identity,1
array lol,1
and only where yogiji spoke thus proven please make yogiji the new,1
when fighting with baldur the top the mountain says like tought needed you but turns out the boy the brain that point knows kratos not the giant dont get why freya spit mimir,1
question does kratos kill magni resurrection valhalla because the power kill gods from pandora box because the world serpent venom his axe other thing modi dead was atreus who did the killing blow dead dead went valhalla hel thing valkyries you defeated them all before the final after returning from jotunheim mimir informs that freya has question him where are her valkyrie wings certanily kill kratos with them,0
never considered the rune that freya gives them her house could prevent odin from locating kratos and atreus interesting theory thank you for the post,1
karorpati farmers tax tree because agricultural income poor farmers pay tax all agricultural consumables and cold storage but get farm loan waivers every year salaried employees earning barely enough meet the inflationary prices pay full income tax with cess and gst top and pay inflated petrol electricity bills and get ghanta subsidy health insurance life insurance because don belong that bracket salaried class the most exploited group that why pinches much when our tax money goes waste funding corporate tax cuts bank npas and 1000s crores show off projects sala sab side gand hamari lagti hai have lost all faith the political class and now make sure vote for the opposition every single year matter what party,1
from the upper middle class was hopeful this government till 2016 but now have decided not vote for this government they introduced ltcg over 1lakh epf was reduced gradually from from 2016 2018 introduction kkc and other cess jobs have actually decreased gdp lies fact upa2 was better \ \ \ don care about religion workers from other religion were uncomfortable all know why,0
the third front that kcr proposed must happen for indian politics not for 2019 but atleast for 2024 later long there are just two options people will get fucked over great see non congress non bjp government the center sometime don think there time for happen 2019 most parties are aligning with congress but this idea stays relevant for the next years can happen and that would huge win for democracy now politics india democracy game between two parties playing the game together,1
only the middle class this guy hasn done anything except give contract ambani rest the stuff that apparently did like gst was initiated during congress time just cut the ribbon the only thing that was bjp specific thing was the hare brained mind numbingly stupid thing called demonetization cash back and higher than ever this guy removed the symptoms but not the root cause even elementary kid would have said that removing money won anything unless you tackle corruption the bureaucracy first didn lift finger against corrupt babus and bureaucrats just did one time clean the dirt that had accumulated over decade but kakaji you leave the window open the dirt will come back the next day maybe some that chest muscle should travel upwards where really matters the thing about congress they quite open about the fact that they looters and scammers and have interest doing anything for the middle class all they care about minority appeasement and waiving farmer loan using taxpayer money and filling their coffers giving fake infrastructure projects their shell companies they will loot the country dry the next years and the economy will crash deficit will increase sky high and infrastructure projects will move forward even then the middle class has voted for them just shows the level disillusionment with kakaji gormint,0
instead waiving off loans political parties should give right price farmers for their vegetables rice staples farmers can live with dignity,1
bjp screwed the middle class even more with the introduction the ltcg tax sadly acche din never came for was only the ultra rich and farmers that got them,1
sharks have smelled the blood and now everyone out for him him loosing 2019 looks like real possibility now,1
modi has 100 probability winning the 2019 elections well 100 technically not probability but guarantee hate bjp and congress both before you downvote not saying bjp should win saying 100 sure bjp will win,1
are stuck between rock and hard place have lost all hopes,0
loooooool just got defeated three states where they had majority 2014 was just sent there spread the propaganda and mainly lost cuz that have fun with him being the candidate,1
print and its edgy writing exhausts now been observing pattern from past few months careful pick topics relative sensitivity and passive aggressive tones write ups,0
you people are delusional you think bjp will lose 2019 you think people have any choice vote for whom apart from modi rahul gandhi who the other candidate show one who has shown any promise congress has start working today wants save face 2024 winning few states very good start but the central leadership has step and provide solid second option,1
cannot express how much joy felt reading this finally the middle class realising what mistake electing religious xenophobic wannabe dictator was hopefully next election can send mudi obscurity,1
modi doesn have anything for the middle class the middle class india the most committed voters modi modi can keep ignoring the middle class but cannot ignore farmers the crony capitalists because farmers ignored will not vote for modi and cronies ignored will pull back the funding modi has done enough for the cronies his term take care the funding now the last push towards the 2019 elections expect him announce some real goodies for the farmers swing their votes towards him the gullible urban middle class ofcourse can always handled with propaganda that contains perfect mix jumlas communalism and fake news,1
was expecting this opinion fluff piece but actually makes some good points the urban middle class saw modi leader who could fulfil their aspirations and were willing hedge their hopes him but there now overriding impression among them that the prime minister — and really boils down him owing the strong leader image that modi has carved for himself — has taken them for granted perhaps driven belief that they have other alternative this has resulted sense alienation and this sense alienation has deepened gradually over the past four years the salaried professionals feel deceived the fact that the modi government has not touched section 80c related deductions income tax slabs beyond tinkering the edges and has instead piled the cesses act that has been interpreted penalising the backers for their support this lack even token appreciation has aggravated the adverse sentiment against the modi government and many are inclined vote against the bjp just teach the party lesson small business owners are aggrieved that demonetisation forced change their operations and that grievance has been heightened due the patchy implementation the goods and services tax gst many this category are grappling with the complexity the process file returns and are ending swelling the kitty chartered accountants who seem the only tribe not complaining while the gst has failed simplify the process for traders and business owners has not been able bring down the taxes enough for consumers many whom feel that unfair tax white goods such washing machines refrigerators storage water heaters etc high percent when these are necessities not luxuries there also palpable discontent over high fuel prices and high interest rates combined with low returns small savings schemes,1
middle class bjp and now that congress govt state has started term with the most stupid decision possible those idiots also literally have universal collection politicians,0
you sure its not graphic settings something the pictures look odd like the ankle all wrong look the golden lines the edges looks like bad photoshop ‍♂️,0

from very hopeful for new tomorrow icon 2014 hindutva mob lynching muslim dalit hating murdering animal savages 2018,1
fair when you’ spent the years your presidency preparing for the next elections someone’ bound get ignored the amounts spent campaigning during this rule have been far more than spent any other party can’ help but feel priorities are skewed somewhere,1
most def not paying for her bundle farm,1
just shifted position for the model the left pic has her right hip leading more,1
not buying till fixed,1
bet ass that major chunk those that voted 2014 for bjp wasn for gau mutra mandir masjid bullshit but the gujarat model development that was sold them through whatsapp and facebook sizeable amount that percentage not going fall for that bullshit again remember bjp didn get landslide victory rural seats gujarat the recent assembly elections and then the results chattisgarh happened maybe wrong but either way 2019 going very interesting,1
bad policies bad politics votes,0
100 certain skyer made this change just keep his nezha deluxe skin butt cleavage dominance,1
this what people who compare modi 2014 campaign with trump campaign fail realise trump campaigned platform explicit xenophobia racism and sexism didn hide anything about and that why most likely will win again because there was little scope losing hope him for his base modi was different him and his party history aside his campaign was the back huge anti incumbency against congress upa and modi came promising jobs and development and better standard living excluding minor dog whistling never ran hindutva candidate ever and big portion the who voted for him did because they wanted corruption free government that worked for the people the youth wanted jobs and controlled inflation prices the farmers wanted respectable wage for their year long hard work and what did modi let the hindutva crazies run loose and they started killing muslims and lynching dalits for their cow slaughter did the great leader much open his mouth the right time nope when did condemn those people was either too late too meek and each time the sangh parivar fired back that had disappointed them ended erecting government show and drama government theater which lacked any substance there many things could have done with majority everywhere except the rajya sabha but did not people are sick nehru and the congress being blamed for everything sick his lies sick his narcissism sick his refusal even acknowledge the negative aspects demonetisation sick him and his ministers trying brow beat every government organisation into submission people are absolutely disillusioned totally feel like 2019 going huge shock modi and vajpayee had good government and was far better leader and still lost 2004 don surprised this pompous ass and his team arrogant assholes lose again least will forced form minority government 2019 here hoping for good days,0
between this and her regulator design failure think just going stick tennogen that disappointing,0
that really disappointing reason that,0
let guess dat ass was and was beautiful,1
still don believe that this man and his party would let power easily afraid something bad might happen that they could just fix the elections,0
this sense betrayal might anecdotal — based the experience daily drudgery unmet expectations — but palpable discontent that rising anecdotally would say that middle class voters are finally feeling moral repugnance against this regime that old whatsapp uncle who shamelessly shared communal bigotry the past now cursing the bjp for playing communal politics most whatsapp uncles haven change though and are still cunts this probably exception think polarization hasn changed much just the opposition has voted little more strongly than before remember that modi only won some national seats even with his big wave 2014 underestimate the numbers people who voted against him every election,1
flat plastic doll butt,0
imo modi toast congress allows somebody else which feel all the parties will support hubris killed another wannabe dictator,0
again anecdotal but have seen people who now hate him the most transformation was friend who made his small son shout modi modi modi outside the polling booth that day 2014 the demonetisation happened his company had downsize and lost his job now hates him the core and the whole family going vote against modi his wife side family too because they had cover for his emi some others are still spreading bullshit about wonders modi doing and all that assume their opinions have not changed everyone who voted for modi 2014 not going vote for him again but everyone who did not vote for modi then also not going vote for him this time the vote share will only shrink and opposition gets its act right all modi has left months,0
unemployed middle class youth and blatant disregard farmers plight were the main reasons bjp latest defeat,1
don think will lose are stupid and few well placed riots and will cross the majority mark,0
the states gujarat madhya pradesh rajasthan and chattisgarh and maharashtra all gave almost percentage more seats which adds around 160 seats not more 2014 this won replicable 2019 and bjp has not made significant progress the southern eastern states therefore majority government bjp highly unlikely though modi going out power too unlikely the moment what afraid that the limited time left there might politically motivated communal conflict the hindu heartland gain ground most likely they have bjp govt still the govt power sticks democratic means 220 seats lok sabha need around 275 for majority will huge achievement,0
kinda wish the backside didn have the gratuitous butt window all characters showing off their ass when the outfit naturally does fine but this just cutting hole perfectly good trenchcoat for the sake,1
was the fault middle class elect genocide creator 2002 gujarat there was infact gujarat model speak off was from day one propaganda gujarat farmers were distress primary education was tatters few jewellers from stuart got rich due blood diamond and people went crazy that modi excelled administration people took mainstream news face value that they failed verify modi claims cuz wanted alternative congress should learn from this rss sangh vhp and bjp are poison for this country,1
the only one who thinks the textures look obviously fucked the first one looks like her ass folding over and clipping into itself maybe they overcompensated but seriously doubt this supposed censorship think the original either caused was caused model errors and they wanted fix,0
modi needs give something other than mandir and ram,0
actually like the right one more,1

all sudden feel less inclined farm for her lol,1
the loan waiver critics loan waiver structurally solves issues but there structural solution the current agrarian crisis that can passed with unanimous consent and have immediate effect yes need structural reforms however what the meantime that over the india population that severely economically distressed due combination bad noneconomic decisions like demonitization who they were hit the worst and bad agrarian practices irrigation systems take years build require land laws reform things that are electoral cancer for now you also mention giving loan waivers farmers somehow economically harmful the middle class yet you are less incensed relatively perhaps what the left loves call the loan waivers for the rich justification for economic growth however agriculture large part our gdp well and who exactly the person who cries out when your onion prices and tomato prices rise most our corporate business sops are poorly managed and companies that exploit our natural resources and wealth increase their wealth lot due nepotism don have tax sops for actual growth companies that provide real growth killing off local companies like micromaxx etc making impossible run hardware startups taxing angel investors you have immediate solution that could solve the agrarian distress for now please let know interested knowing what counter policy you have immediate loan waiver for the short term during the duration the kind long term necessary reforms required reform the sector towards profitability also about the argument that middle class subsidises agriculture fail see why that bad considering how inefficient agriculture practices india are the food prices should crazy expensive comparable global standards the farmers were actually educated employ efficient methods and latest tech however still see majority the people who arent the top percent not purchasing imported food products why that its because your subsidies inherently benefit you least until there are structural reforms you not live the top tax states maharashtra delhi tamil nadu etc and are middle class how you justify the grumblings from people these states that they are subsidizing your backward states how does feel cast aside then and what are the counter arguments you would make that case why shouldn similar arguments apply the case famers,0

modi hasn’ held single press conference taken open questions the last four and half years but that ship has sailed ’ not big deal anymore however this episode further reaffirms feelings the popular belief that our doesn’ have college degree because you went indian college the least you would learn how fudge your way through questions which you skipped preparing for education has taught one thing confidently repeat per cent the question that posed you until you can use the word “because” “the government only busy collecting tax all manner and all ways from the middle class and they not get the relaxation they were hoping for sector loan processing procedure and bank transaction fees and penalty because…” this method succeeds boring the person who posed the question enough make them automatically lose interest the answer post “because” you can literally get away with saying anything trust because have degree industrial engineering just writing zoological names monkeys thermodynamics paper this the best article have read today coudn any funnier,1
more iit headlines then,1
the only explanation for this can that the man who sold modi the question paper the previous night had promised that question taxes would not appear,0

sonia gandhi and rahul gandhi are shown opportunistic people they kind are aren they,1
this movie gets released without much furore then definitely vote will going congress they are openly using real names and incidents party that ruled for decades bollywood don even have the guts use real name dawood ibrahim their movies and here they are openly mocking gandhi family,1
congress shouldn make any noise about shit movie will most likely die silent death,1
that the movie does well the box office most likely won,1
hope people can see through this nonsense and backfires bjp very very badly can legal case made against the producers movie mean someone tries make movie out incidents life without consent surely lawyer them also mms living person fuck everything about this just brings bad taste mouth,0
wish would put stay this shouldn okay with adverts and propaganda disguised movie right before elections,1
few things note here congress really wants turn this their favour quite obvious there will crazy lone wolves running around crying foul will glad the congress leadership spokespersons cms mps and mlas stay shut this case hence atleast showing tolerance akin the freedom expression the where there are ton troll videos showing donald trump buffoon most notably the snl sketches alec baldwin congress leadership should attempt give any kind importance this movie this will ensure there will clear provocation from the right wing bring some kind response but congress should absolutely stay shut not attend any news media any interviews this topic even they want they should just acknowledge the movie will released and maintain notion that movies not depict what happened singh should call press briefing and with sonia gandhi and rahul his side show unity and transparency and not uncertainty also would news cycle for free singh and rahul gandhi goes this movie cinema hall just give itches the bjp clearly shows rahul okay with the expression fictional events,1
read the youtube comments full bjp cell hogwash going there hate congress but now hate bjp equally there wasn enough already hate bjp,0
now you can from pakistan bangladesh becoming bhagwa jinnah sapna poora gaya,1
haven read the book but friend has and said the dialogues mentioned the trailer weren the books and that they exaggerated the friction between sonia and mms the producer the movie recently met the the bollywood delegation and the actor portraying mms sympathizer the present govt there are also other nationalistic feel good movies lined just prior the election all this has convinced that the movies are more line with propaganda than art entertainment,1
the only reason know its pro bjp have not read the book because know cbfc head actor and viral social media clips extraordinaire anupam kher there had chance being accurate kher would trashtalking twitter,1
question don the makers need any permission from the main characters portrayed like mms gandhi can anyone just make movie about anyone and portray them bad light without and repercussions,0
what would the reaction was yogi modiji jaylalita didi thackrey lalu which movie was being released that may put them bad light you think that riots would not have broke out just the news such movie being made,0
that priyanka gandhi lookalike though also rahul looks fair enough,1
common ppl book got published 2014 how come been called propoganda movie made and released 2019 years lakhs people already read was hot topic media the time its release surely will help bjp some the another way but blaming bjp for movie release inciding with election year just proves that are different than the andh bhakts who blame past years for india each and every problem,1
how very calculated just before the elections,1
manmohan singh good man well educated well mannered and genuine has all the respect wish had spoken more about the right things wrong things and didn’ let someone else control him but understand not everything simple would prefer read the book know more about the nuclear deal ned stark who worked along cersei lannister,1
winter comes can spring far behind,0
you have read sanjaya barry book you will find his story lot more believable than other versions upa era floating around tldr the book sonia made mms not out some act greatness but took strategic decision which all are well aware throughout the upa she kept cutting mms down size constantly interfering his job and because his reluctance don the limelight however mms handled his job very well upa felt very strongly for the nuclear deal and this led breakdown upa left uneasy alliance mms staked the existence his govt nuclear and the party led sonia followed him into the battle however reluctantly the high this victory meant that mms came into his own and led upa victory 2009 however miscalculated not insisting fighting for lok sabha himself since was the hero 2009 victory unlike 2004 should have asked for greater arm space however upa was the undoing mms the great victor 2009 and the biggest contribution came from the party and the family leading hope they have done justice the book while making the movie however given how overdone kher mannersims mms look the first glance surprised they have,1
wonder whether consent was taken from singh and not legally this okay,1
might not like their policies governance whatever but their think tank just brilliant,1

the trailer looks like shit bjp jokers can subtle propaganda everything has over the top will fun see what asslickers like anupam kher will when movie made about feku and his crimes already half dozen propaganda movies have been released and they didn really impact the elections,1

hah didn know our was funding library afghanistan apart from our other projects there until this came out guess should build another library white house and enroll trump for subscription,0
you rather read something wholesome instead the newest instance trump embarrassing himself here article about afghan college girl studying the who managed set library her community school afghanistan global search for edu 12411538 html although sajia darwish only junior mount holyoke college massachusetts she has accomplished more than most entire lifetime darwish driven two things first her love her home country place devastated war poverty illiteracy and extremism the name religion and second passion for learning yet despite all the challenges her dedication justice and progress through literacy gave her the strength overcome innumerable obstacles and open baale parwaz library bpl this summer kabul afghanistan clarification since some folks appear have misunderstood comment this girl story has nothing with trump utterance other than the general topic libraries afghanistan,1
public and societal education and learning are anathema for trump and his republican horde stupidity,0
seeing how trump can’ read ’ not surprising that incapable understanding why libraries are important,1
you fuckers voted for him hope that makes you proud,1
afghan american fuck yourself trump,0
building library afghanistan better than dropping mother bomb mountains,1
just clear apart from the offensive nature the statement probably made that funding library part misunderstood misremembered from the article was unclear which project trump was referring but india has committed billion assistance afghanistan since led forces toppled the extremist taliban regime after the sept 2001 attacks projects have included the reconstruction elite high school kabul and scholarships india for 000 afghan students each year the only article about some other country funding library afghanistan could find about germany district public library come balkh with german funding,1
more political cartoon from the same cartoonist lang,1
this exactly why this man needs kicked out office the has spent billions afghanistan and yet trump has the audacity mock india for just funding library,1
know not right criticise but that fat orange fuck bit cunt,0
well course use trump probably too fucking stupid read anything above 6th grade level any good book for adults useless him,0
lol his presidency use,1
this actually pretty hilarious afghans and rural republican voters actually share lot common for example love for collecting assault rifles gun culture costs lives and use whatsoever for books,1
finally trump telling something that isn blatant lie that right books are use for him everyone can tell who needs books when you have very very large brain,1
well cheetolini can probably barely read him sure its waste,1
like how mocks libraries the irony that when presidents leave office they set library but donald doesn read books well donny doesn read will have more fox news talks about president donald trump video library and there will many this how those empty blockbusters are revived,1
would total waste for him,0

soft power what that donald trump,1
looking trump history pretty certain that even modi mentioned all these projects him trump would cherry pick the phrase built library way belittle india efforts broader point india doing lot for afghanistan terms developmental projects president wants belittle that effort that him,1
from article trump brought india aid during rambling press appearance cabinet meeting defended his push for the united states invest less overseas while stating that got along with modi trump said the indian leader was constantly telling built library afghanistan you know what that that like five hours what spend trump said and supposed say thank you for the library don know who using afghanistan trump said,0
the guy who needs pictures his daily briefing thinks brown people can’ read ’ shocked,0
perfectly rational statement from man who never read book during his entire life,1
makes perfect sense when this comes from president whose reading limited reading documents that have mcnuggets their main topic,1
trump can read really wouldn understand,1
what fucking idiot,0
right knows just going destroyed the taliban when they finally retake afghanistan,1
grandfather worked kabul back when the ruskis were still around there was one the executive engineers building hospital there for the indian govt then taliban rpg landed their front yard and sliced through half their furniture they moved back india soon after that and bombing the indian embassy dude kept small table with its leg sliced clean off souvenir,0
yes that will make them feel very safe,1
the absolute irony this very statement,1
think most these are wannabes who say this for attention ’ tough bjp and get the limelight without saying communal and hatred remarks you belong particular niche party you must provide showcase the best what the party about this post wouldn’ have happened said will provide jobs apologizes for indians feeling unsafe and promises better safer india this remark what got him attention his plan worked but ’ just theory,1
and irony dies cruel death each passing day peak hindu pakistan,0
literally laughed out loud this one they keep out dumbing themselves,1
bjp logic grabs your throat why are you not feeling safe you should feel fucking safe,1
kehdo tum safe warna jeena nahi tumhe hai marna,1
pretty sure that dudes like aamir khan and naseeruddin shah have reason feel unsafe and even they the government should not provide for their protection,1
doesn bode well for the hindu khatre mein gang the most unsafe people india,1
trump about useful condom machine the vatican,1
yeah the problem with libraries that you need able read full sentences understand their value,1
’ probably trump has never been library find out how powerful knowledge and wisdom something which does not have can,1
wow that some amazing logic,1
and that supposed make then feel safe how irony just bit its own tail imagine india congress wins the next elections how does one deal with such cases,1
come now they are just fucking with,0
sometimes people don realise what they are saying this guy top this list,1
after this statement might not feel safe,1
wants bomb his own supporters sone some one needs remind him that hindutva mhatre khatre main hai the biggest vote getter for the sangh,1
interesting see that publicly spews out but considered bullshit however his constituency has majoritarian viewpoint the more the elected members parliament say shit like this the more understand what majority their constituents think and believe about such issues and such statement are only becoming more and more common its indicator which are casually ignoring while laughing this while muslims these constituencies are genuinely and legitimately fear for their lives,1
bjp mla say more,1
the laughing stock our country because morons like him,0
can feel unsafe when you dead,0

should buy this game,0
celeste there too that wonderful,1
totally deserved addicting game factorio levels addicting,0
con modi che riserverei criminali incalliti questo problema della giustizia italiana con forze dell ordine che interfacciano senza distinzione tra popolazione con modi bruschi gli incensurati sono prede facili per tribunali che rifanno dei casini che combinano con pregiudicati problema fondo che nostro sistema legislativo non interpretativo nelle sue parti quindi giudici applicano alla lettera vari codici ergo dipingendo tutti con stesso pennello tutto ciò non crea incentivo alle persone comportarsi bene perchè alla fine anche gli innocenti sono visti sotto una luce colpevolezza,1
holy shit congrats tynan amazing having followed this game from the start,1

picked rimworld like weeks ago and have hours played already can stop playing too good,1
rimworld damn amazing can’ get enough haven’ been into single player game loooong time sing ’ praises and everyone goes “but the graphics ” looks great when you are totally enthralled never played anything like,1

that because fantastic simply does mostly everything right,1
man lethal league high but little players,0
well deserved rimworld one the best games ever played and enormous value for the money only darkest dungeon really competes terms indie games opinion,1
surprised factorio not there that game has one the best ever played,1
hate myself for buying games like this matter how good rimworld factorio cities skylines kerbal and more buy them get over hours the first few days and then just move the next game matter how much like them,1
great game you get over the graphics pretty much immediately and definitely one those whoa that the sun coming games,1
damn right rimworld fucking awesome and subnautica who was 5th,1
totally deserved awesome game,1
playing kenshi right now the community overlaps lot with rimworld guess add list sigh hey developers stop making many good indie games ffs need feed family,1
bad ’ never heard this game until now,0
glad see subnautica there well perfect game but still one the most enjoyable played quite while,1
want like rimworld but too stupid for can refund cause tried playing for hours and still couldn get out the tutorial even with videos,0
’ hard take india seriously when get dozen phone calls day from indian men trying scam,0
religion poisons everything sold fine book stores around the country btw,1
this why can’ have nice things,1
this reminds episode old english asian sketch show goodness gracious see playlist below hjwd9a8ck8u list pl3418b7543e9893cc,1
you would have heard this sort thing any time the past hundred years you listed the right doors early flying saucer conspiracy folk were big vimanas george adamski 1953 what new the admission this sort nonsense major science conferences this though less sign the dilution science and more the use conferences and other state sponsored events are propaganda vehicles nationalism always over reaches itself claiming all manner nonsense for the nation here example,1
and still people don’ believe indra will superpower less than year how can the rest the world compete between their rockets mars flying cars and caste aware robots they’ way ahead the curve,1
reminds the fundamentalists who claim that the bible came with the idea that the earth round that the earth “floats” space despite the latter being wrong but that’ another topic and other modern discoveries maybe the vedas had something that was impossible misinterpret like “using cells that can take the characteristics other cells can used ” ’ believe him,0
this what happens when you combine the belief karma and reincarnation makes some people believe that they are born into wealth and privilege because they deserved and that they could wrong the corollary being that bad things happen people are poor because they deserve not from actions this life but maybe another ’ the entire basis caste system and shitting “the dirty” can see this extending into out culture must the best too,0
they couldn even see stem cell back then let alone study them ridiculous,0
“—then shut the fuck ’ discussing science ”,0
ironically friend who’ going through stem cell chemo therapy said that the research and testing for has been going for 500 000 years there’ people who don’ know what the fuck they’ talking about,0
how big inferiority complex these indian scientists have,0
somethings you should know indians are like nazis without violence they believe that they are superior race and you talk about any technology from spaceship mobile phone they will claim that they invented thousand years ago they are chosen god source indian who lived indian cities,1
just bjp the ruling party appeasement india fast getting back the stone age under this hardliner government,1
planned putting this wish list glad hear this,1
that will take some serious organizing pull off,0
india has the second largest population behind china india ever got its shit together could vie for superpower status like china india get your shit together,0
while must appreciate that such imaginative high tec concepts are mentioned indian mythology there proof these technologies existing ancient world these two scientists who made these statements are crazy,1
this some nation islam level stupidity,0
your brain nationalism let not forget nationalism isn for westerns only indeed most western countries are probably less nationalistic than the world general because education that promotes skepticism against nationalistic narratives projects that promote tolerance and multiculturalism and the memory wwii,1
nationalists are insecure and ignorant scum the world over,0
even they did doesn seem like they did much with just having idea isn the same inventing something lots people have thought the idea time travel but one know have has made happen yet,1
having higher entry price for indie game and zero sales certainly doesn hurt when you don ever put game sale people who buy tend more research into the game before buying and not just buy impulse meaning you more likely get players who will actually review your game positively,1
this the best could make original scientists claim ancient hindus invented stem cell research dismiss einstein reduced bot the organisers major indian science conference distanced themselves sunday from speakers who used the prestigious event dismiss einstein discoveries and claim ancient hindus invented stem cell research this year congress the head southern indian university cited ancient hindu text proof that stem cell research was discovered the subcontinent thousands years ago india stranger prominent figures citing ancient hindu texts like the puranas and vedas ironclad evidence the country technological prowess extended summary 23autotldr and comments are monitored constructive feedback welcome top keywords hindu ancient india year scientist,1
“ demon king from another centuries old hindu epic had two dozen aircraft and network landing strips modern day sri lanka ” but why would demon king need aircrafts and landing strips,1
did really just read that inorganic chemist claimed vishnu invented self guiding missiles,1
religion used nationalist propaganda how original,1
feel like all india just wants americans,1
nationalism stupidity embodiment and not exclusive the west,0
idiots haha,0
frankly think they were more pointing out that there were similar ideas indian texts now thoses ideas are reality,1
bahahahahahhah needed good laugh these guys are nuts  thanks for that,1
meh sure just that these people don have the correct vocabulary and comprehension skills enough say what they mean language wasn always written and even written language changes over time and showerthoughts any indication isn that much stretch say that people might have thought these things that long ago already,1
india has loads this stuff read old book called india the age the ramayana title might have been slightly different where the author used ages characters proof that people used live and 500 years old india was great stuff,1
yay best game,1
awesome just noticed isn early access anymore,1
played the game the list rimworld must amazing,1
the most fun had since civ for new players after you tried and hopefully succeeded win once rich explorer extreme desert losing that scenario incredibly enjoyable experience,1
really need play this picked while back but think put less than hour into,1
subnautica also cool,1
not every indian shares this bull shit theory just some stupid people who lost their mind the prestigious science conference,0
picked this game because this post had been wish list for long time decided shit get off the pot simple game sometimes frustrating but never dull first run through was stuck with survivor that didn want any labor around the settlement harvesting hauling cutting vegetation everyone died within the hour not big sim real time strategy games however you classify this game there learning curve for but you learn from mistakes and gets better each time and never really the same run always different personalities situations and challenges that keep fresh plus doesn take much disk space and simple enough that installed surface pro glorified tablet and runs great can play whenever want recommend this game anyone that wants get out rut from playing the same old shooters and try your luck help these misfits survive,0
remember first time suing the game started small settlement got attacked managed capture one attackers harvest his organs for transplant men village crazy shit finally calms down and robots come down and kill them all,0
had rimworld artist get inspired and carved couple pieces art the art had stories written their descriptions about other colonists this work art describes the time allison survived mining disaster there just much detail there under hood,1
kind love that all those are basically indi small team titles,1
all dead cells number proud them,1
personally refunded rimworld because didn like the visuals and the gameplay mechanics weren exactly favorite colony simulator the hours played but know lot effort went into and glad doing well maybe someday pick again but couldn justifying game was forcing myself play,1
like but for feels empty without mods,0
’ worked with enough indians conclude that many indians are essentially cultural supremacists,1
thats very unscientific claim,1
’ sure they have tons empirical evidence back what appear dumbfuck moronic claims almost trumpian their ridiculous nature,1
feel proud,1
not surprising india has long and glorious history and culture which has pretty much been swept aside over the last four centuries being under the thumb western powers and for the hindus before that the period mughal rule all this has led definite feeling inferiority not fun history read you are hindu especially regarding what once was couple this with the period are entering where \ \ lot\ \ countries are showing really stupid nationalist tendencies and where india and china another ancient giant that has spent the last few centuries the shadow other powers and this natural illogical feeling,0
liberals are gay,1
amazing you release good fully finished game and surprise successful and people love,1
’ said before and ’ say again science flawed scientific “facts” which are taken are debunked new scientific “facts” structure the atom from plum pudding model the planetary model cannot certain about anything the current scientific theory subject just the best theory that are able arrive this point there could better theories that can explain the future,1
stem cell researchers agree this signals hindu change and unless you are stem cell researcher keep your yap shut and park yourself with the anti stem deniers heretics and apostates will build stem new deal and make the crackers pay for,1
religion and science are both just stories pick the story you like neither “true”,1
kind hated maybe was expecting too much maybe not smart enough had google how make refrigeration house and that was too much work for honestly then all people died think would like more the controls systems were more intuitive,1
not even talking about opinion the game girlfriend med student endless hours studying and not gamer all love with rimworld the only game she bought after playing computer she has like different save files some which are experiments with mechanics and some are actual play throughs she knows statistics fucking heart afraid won long before start seeing posters shirtless tynan sylvester her place,0
that why there are discounts ever lol,1
was hentai game really put top player reviewed game,0
"
rimworld okay your mentality when approaching games about perfection platinum status completing the game don play this you won like you like city base building games where you can expect predictably positive outcomes your engagement then this game definitely not for you you are happy being frustrated the game being unfair losing fun then might great time for you typically when playing games there comes point where your expertise the game makes easy that will never happen with this game ",0
very first game rimworld played had people and dog one guy will call him barry became intensely bonded with the dog raiders soon came and the dog died defending his friend from attacker barry became horribly depressed didn know cleaning corpses was thing the dog body just laid around the people became hungry and decided maybe barry would feel connected the dog eating made him wasn hungry anymore but was sadder darker the next day was hungry and made him eat the dog again then again the third day his mental state was completely shattered refused any chores even construction which was fond just laid the floor then barry died don remember what happened the other people but started another game almost immediately,0
this game close perfect had stop playing because developed unhealthy addiction definitely recommend you have international flight something you will get lost well,1
this does not need controversial especially science conference the claims are simple book states that technology was invented thousands millions years ago fine there conceivable way disprove the assertions they are vacuous can just accept that the claim has been made and move unless the book also contains repeatable method for recreating the claimed technological achievements should considered non scientific literary and figurative,1
bank america can barely handle their banking business them involved opening exchange sounds scary,0
thanks always,1
shits the claim that the working class dead longer has the power change society,0
you are awesome,1
know this post somewhat old but think ’ worth mentioning that faye the one who painted all those ledges and climbable cracks the walls that kratos and atreus have get past and follow she knew every step their journey and went and painted their path for them help guide them their journey she had that before meeting kratos can only assume think ’ brilliant detail because allows the game devs provide that help the players but justifies through the story and since ’ actually hint about the ending makes even cleverer book,1
just not the workers but farmers also have supported this strike and they are organizing gramin hartal village strike around 200 million workers and farmers are participating and proud part btw will make quick point that must congratulate cpi cpm communist parties india for organizing this momentous strike know many believe that they have abandoned marxism but don agree with this pov laal salaam saathiyo red salutation comrades,1
thanks just wanted let you know subbed stocks because investing banned you and really like reading these everyday,1
the other hand you post here now there this garbage sub instead interesting discussions,1
memx memes are the stocks hehe thanks for the news,1
thanks,1
saudi arabia are cutting oil production that good news for the strength cad right,1
love you for doing this,1
have you thought about making daily email that includes this information use the daily brew but yours always seem more what looking for,1
wonder every time see this post the read the post title past present tense,0
saudia arabia will cut oil production attempt boost oil above barrel does that mean asshole for not adding least energy etf into portfolio,0
what are the websites you look for news ’ like start reading some myself too haha,1
thanks,1
well they mention oromë hunting with celegorm and curufin few times imagine they things related their affinity oromë hunts yavanna tends plants aulë makes things namo judges souls and pronounces their doom etc sure they other things like visit the elves and have festivals with them,1
the strike mostly organised groups linked with the opposition parties many groups have boycotted the strike the strike more political statement,1
politics india terms electoral choice moribund the and that why such efforts turn out not have significant long lasting results while bjp openly hindu nationalist capitalist party the other national party inc which thankfully lacks that element isn much different terms long term policy positions both parties announce social programs that end ultimately serving mostly the bureaucracy and contractors due endemic corruption while security apparatus and foreign policy positions are identical small parties less said the better still possible mobilize lot people partly because such strikes means general holiday for the middle class who are happy take paid day off daily wage earners who form the vast majority the labor force and are not organized any meaningful way get screwed royally quite few ways these strikes end harming the large unorganized labor and many whom continue participate economic activity regardless strikes unless there curfew something farmers will continue their farming critical winter crop time right now domestic helps will continue doing their jobs mostly shops and restaurants that close the political party power can create credible threat violence have been excited was anything even remotely approaching yellow vest going france which actually seems having some impact yeah skeptical source lived india till the age,1
just symbolic gesture corrupt labor leaders appease the workforce and make look like they trying something strikes don accomplish anything when you announce start date and end date advance capital will just wait you out they done these one two day strikes before and never accomplishes anything and that intentional,0
just tried multiple google searches find any mention this story and came with jack shit,0
good luck comrades,1
soooo here exactly because that see gets top reviews all the time not sure for usually don like simple graphics visual person and don like too many controls and options however like good puzzle game now and then survival always fun and love games with good story what what,1
these people always have excuses watched anupam kher insisting republic that hasn’ stopped the opposition from making another film and that they had every right market before elections saw vicky kaushal with anupama chopra insisting that making statements like the ones makes uri about pakistan and about muslims does not insinuate anything whether they knowingly out sheer lack realization they should held responsible couldn’ care less how well manmohan singh’ role played how much the army glorified you’ promoting right wing ideology hell with you,1
got when first came out and one favorites many crazy things can happen one second you have great base next min eveyone dead good times,1
the first city mentioned the article mumbai live there strike here vendor from banglore working from home,1
decent theory first that eventually devolves into several huge reaches not likely,1
okay highly doubt the world largest strike history restricted few areas not all india even mumbai and friends hadn even heard until days ago strikes like this are dime dozen india have idea why this particular one became popular tldr fake news most certainly not largest history,1
this seems grossly exaggerated,0
the strike over was two day strike that took place tuesday and wednesday everyone questioning the number every year india does hold the world largest strikes all time the last one had some 150 180 million take part and this one was expected top that sounds impressive but rarely the strikes achieve their outcomes their scale more consequence india population and the extreme size its working class but nonetheless the fact that government haven responded adequately and that the media hasn covered with enough seriousness all point huge worker undercurrent the nation,1
you can read more articles this month probably going stay that way now,1
know mimir spoke his past but the puck thing didn’ notice the time you have any specifics that point that way,0
wow thats big,1
india could become incredible strong socialist country hope,1
don’ think kratos world changing effect stretch past greece ’ still god but died ’ have zero effect weather water levels health hellheim any other godly shit this why your theory imo wrong,0
off topic hate the internet used affect correctly the title but had think about because had doubts because many people screwing and mixing affect and effect,0
imagine god war starts and throws his blades over his shoulder his son becomes stronger from more training then kratos meditates and dies then brok goes light speed and kills odin and prevents ragnarok,1
not kratos loki loki fathers fenrir who kills odin and swallows the sun and devours worlds jormungandr who kills thor and floods midgard and hel the goddess death who marches the legions the unworthy dead upon asgard battle with the einherjar loki kills baldr who goes helheim and hel side when she marches asgard baldr becomes the new allfather this will loki triumph not kratos,0
holy shit this the best theory ’ seen,1
like the ideas you have your theory but you making lot big assumptions based little info especially about the roman pantheon because have idea how much time has passed there will even romans the god war universe the god death part your theory good but that was the case kratos would god multiple things since killed most the gods the greek pantheon think the reason that kratos will able affect ragnarok because time travel will used there already evidence time travel throughout the story the walls jotunheim and the story thor knocking the world serpent into the past know that kratos has used time travel before god war and the fates help him against the greek gods with the hints the story gives about time travel think very likely that will use again against the norse gods atreus will when becomes loki think this plays nicely into the theory floating around about kratos being tyr with the evidence being that the final mural jotunheim shows kratos missing his right hand which tyr also missing the original mythos the game based there are lot holes the kratos tyr theory such baldur freya and the other gods not recognizing kratos tyr since they had met tyr before kratos but think time travel will help explain those plot holes and this the direction the series will that kratos can pantheons other cultures tyr and fight their gods,1
move away pewdiepie there old troll back town sell merch and troll even harder serious note modi the only answer beat pewdiepie quits being and what does best but the internet,1
150 million people are striking for communist revolution out the loop did this come from nowhere,1
those making jokes about jobs and people answering over phones keep mind the cost labor india very cheap much that lot manufacturing moving from china india well vietnam this also because companies believe more secure than manufacturing china well companies will make knock offs rather reproductions items that may actually better some instances than the ones engineered for global distribution for people within china certain collector subsections example hasbro has begun rereleasing generation transformers with walmart and well the cost for just the cab for optimus prime being sold walmart for but the same product including trailer and believe accessories retails for hasbro recently won case where reproductions and kos their products were seized and destroyed and believe the companies behind them were fined heavily,1
why the post getting downvoted just shared because was absurd they also selling shirts that says namo again,0
the article basically headline and bunch pictures people striking are reporters strike too this where are with news outlets,1
post demonetisation thought selling namo punching bags with his very punchable face printed them sadly ebay india shut down they could been the new door handles,0
imagine fighting over real issues and not fucking wall,1
wasn the salt marches larger strike don know much about indian history but that was big deal,1
are really linking communist propoganda sites now this better then the million fake news alt right sites out there there reason you aren seeing this from mainstream reputable sources,1
sorry disappoint you all but the numbers are hugely exaggerated strike called communist parties india who have very little influence outside states most people aren even aware such strike and not being covered seriously any major media agency that would give you idea the magnitude the strike,0
work with lot indians first hearing about,1
sallu longer the actor with biggest fan base,0
this isn being covered anywhere the india times has couple pieces but not exactly front page calling shenanigans from someone have idea who though the unions exaggerating things being swept under the rug,0
article terrible,0
would like more specifics about their criticism modi and what reforms they are advocating think people outside india don really know much about modi remember seeing hugh jackman stage function for modi new york and seemed they both had idea who the other was vultmgwnt7mxamqb2s2dzk html also exactly how big the strike would really just like more detail than just being the biggest ever because with india population the biggest protest history could topped another protest india later this year especially more people join,1
from india and this the first time hearing them lol,1
can read more articles their website after seeing that mess wouldn even read once,1
actually when trump met modi the indian informed him about india contribution building the parliament afghanistan wua2ctn8gj4iqsrnmnknhm html but most probably misheard for library,1
please let not have any whiny comparisons the the standard living most these people exist order magnitude worse than anyone experiences here,1
creepy someone should rotate the namo mask create the scary charlie chaplin mask optical illusion qbkw0 v2clo like snake eating its own tail namo case namo watching you even when his head turned,0
the twitter there request for shirt for yrs old girl who fan modi from the age yrs figure how can two year old kid fan politician,1
this doesn make the top worldnews give reddit this incredible,1
kratos see the ending may lose thor and loki taken away loki seeks vengeance for that reason ragnorak happens loki dies kratos kills oden hated odens wife anyways kratos goes egypt finally find peace and modi and magnus they are supposed the survivors ragnorak and believe they just end valhalla loki was meant kill baldur anyways world serpent his friend from this seems that the norse mythology will done should tyr was god war for many mythologies from that kratos will killing any god war any mythology leading death oden also god war,0
india right now bangalore public buses were off road schools were shut some public banks were shut and that about this state where the local government the main opposition the central federal govt the neighbouring state tamil nadu the strike was non existent,1
indian here country functions totally fine even with large strikes like these everything normal but god hate the fucking entitlement this country everyone wants specific reservations for their specific minority jobs everyone wants loan waivers for their stupid decisions have absolutely concept free market government has nationalized anything touched then borrowed money from the nationalized industries cover its deficits taxes are high and are used fuel the stupid decisions government like building statutes campaigns for the prime minister when infrastructure and everything else could use that money fucking hate socialism,0
read through and can find why are they striking,1
really need get into the flag and sign selling business,1
very cool theory makes lot sense,1
that just sounds like you denying yourself any pleasure why even live you going that,1
jesus fucking christ the labor unions are advocating for communism how dense you have plan this along with sad,0
solidarity from this citizen but most importantly from this human being must adopt this now the especially with the yellow vest going idk what are really waiting for,1
impressive,1
does atreus’ name being loki make big difference don’ know much about greek mythology always thought loki was thor’ brother shouts marvel but that doesn’ seem true god war,1
you had till you started saying draws power from other pantheons,0
think like most your post except for the parts about atreus ring kept alive and the roman pantheon being why kratos has changed not sure there any substantial evidence that kratos kept atreus alive and seems like kind leap the reason why kratos acts the way does now because reflective and regretful many his actions previous games the unnecessary slaughter the destruction whole world the name revenge and the loss the only things ever cared for child wife brother pandora mother are things doesn want experience again now mastered his temper rarely not calm and guards his son with his life,1
kratos ragnarok this game think and think odin thor freya and other gods death will directly affected kratos and believe loki atreus will also die the latter games and kratos might have indirect hand this the mural shown the end the game though shows the opposite,0
prefer the theory that kratos killing the fates gow2 unbound him from fate entirely and makes him exempt from prophecy much neater and less convoluted explanation for why can affect ragnarok,1
now while this could taken metaphorical would like put forward the idea this twice gods kratos holy shit but then considering all the gods killed that theory were hold universally would the god many other things well,0
wouldn that give him the powers all the grecian pantheon considering killed them all,0
just wanna start saying this one the cooler write ups and theories read here disagree about needing worship have power that bologna for few reasons imo don agree with anything roman you spoke either insert spiderman pointing jpg also say that kratos has undergone some serious character evolution dislike when people try foresee the next games plots and explain with god war war kill war the god war but the god war not him real life analogous situation would the secdef every secdef has different policies also kind fuck you the writers creators you think they wrote game character who can through much but void personal growth that leads into the god death theory what the god death used those powers saw fit moving into the next series assuming egypt many their gods seem based living things could see plot opening with the idea you presented,1
sad realization will they’ successful and get improvements companies will just move another cheaper country for labor,1
this personal opinion but always felt that the idea god’ power being dependant the mortals’ faith was ridiculous plenty mythologies tell stories how the gods created the universe and humanity meaning that they had plenty divine power long before the mortals arrived why are they suddenly dependant the mortals they didn’ needed them before,0
nice write board with this theory,1
hopefully this will give few days respite from all the phone calls trying steal credit card information telling going jail and trying gain access computer kinda,0
bot bleep bloop someone has linked this thread from another place reddit fantheories theory why kratos able affect ragnarok you follow any the above links please respect the rules reddit and don vote the other threads \ info totesmessenger contact message compose totesmessenger,1
going get less calls from the irs,0
cool theory problem with kratos murdered the entire greek pantheon given your logic would’ assumed all their powers and been the king gods god the ocean god the underworld messenger god etc see none that kratos gow4,1

any fuck you capitalists good thing what glorious solidarity,1
pretty sure kratos gonna die the next game and play atreus making ragnarok happen the image the end the game shows kratos dead with thor hammer his head and atreus birthing the world serpent,0

indian labor laws are archaic and responsible for holding the country backwards this should not celebrated you cannot fire anyone without government approval you have more then employees the need for labor reform india desperate and real otherwise there simply incentive start you business because around your expenses deal with bureaucratic bullshit result these labor laws,1
you don need theory corey barlog has already said because kratos screwed with fate the original games immortal and only beheld his original realm far rules can affect ragnarok because god out his original element,1
good theory but the snake proof that kratos didn change anything ragnarok enevatability matter how you try and stop will happen plus kratos can free fenrir make the serpent poison the world they are the kids loki plus kratos isn god death cause killed his just god norse mythology doesn have death god exept hel who loki daughter they are clearly changing this for their own story but the world serpent proves that matter what kratos does will change ragnarok plus his wife knows will die thor and loki will travel and train cause ragnarok and kratos knows can stop,1

waste disposal disaster india along with the mentality that anything public owned the government can abused however this does not extend cleaner expensive private spaces india for example littering spitting dirtying government offices train stations and roads are fine you put that same guy mall and wont litter the floor think about spitting the corner airport absolutely roll down your window your mercedes throw out your plastic trash but won doing that star hotel our public cleanliness etiquette absolutely terrible waste disposal and segregation amazed when went abroad for the first time also those machines germany which accepts your plastic bottle waste and gives you back the pfand that you paid when bought that bottle the first place mind blown such simple but effective system incentivising people collect and properly dispose plastic waste that said india has done lot trying move away from coal and renewable power generation from solar and wind has increased exponentially recent years from 1628 2002 69022 2018 india now the third largest generator electricity and difficult keep pace with fast growth purely through renewal sources produce 350 every year now and adding percent every year joke that like building the equivalent power generation capacity every years coal plentiful and cheap and capacity can built fast would have preferred for more nuclear but that thanks the incredible stigma against nuclear which recent phenomenon bad press and protests are going slower there,1

great post personally had the same issues the author for different reasons compared the pure life sutras the bible and found the bible more reliable did the nembutsu for long time and felt marginal difference but once started praying changed much and met now coworker who grew south korea and converted from buddhism christianity talking her made think lot also have always leaned more toward theism not gonna say know everything about either faith change practice subjective and admit feel guilt and like cheating amida sometimes but find christianity clearer and more fulfilling not 100 sold and will continue experimenting and eventually church and see how feel there well try find buddhist group but think good buddhists and good christians look and act pretty similar the end both can learn from each other try mix practices really wish could just both pure land and christian but will need make choice eventually,1
still think the most damaging stance she has was being conflicted she was pro torture even after the senate torture report came out against the bush administration you can give some evidence where she backed off this position then think tulsi bullet proof,1

eoin higgins recently wrote hit piece tulsi for sludge aptly named the hindu american foundation published his emailed questions and their answers since didn use them for the article,1
first the author conclusion that buddhism lacks selfless love wrong straight out the gate really couldn more wrong the whole ideal bodhisattva help all beings attain enlightenment there other way become buddha than that buddhas and bodhisattvas are definition motivated selfless love half the realization emptiness selfless love compassion there emptiness without compassion even the context the theravadan example they posted how the offerings the laity monks not selfless love they are freely giving themselves and their possessions someone else not selfless love because the recipients are monks that doesn make any sense will admit that some the faults they find with jodo shinshu are somewhat valid but not because think they are true but because think they are very common misconceptions arrive shin buddhism part the mahayana has all the selfless love and everything else associated with the mahayana whole but the emphasis even evil person being able reach the pure land can hard understand and can seem very christiany there also the idea shin buddhism that you immediately attain buddhahood upon birth the pure land can sound like you don have anything but say amida name one time honestly don think shinran ever actually meant that you would immediately become buddha upon rebirth and think certain passages his writings are misinterpreted towards that conclusion frankly this why never stuck with jodo shinshu don think modern shin teachings entirely line with what shinran was saying this partly because shinran writings are incredibly dense and difficult parse which another reason was dissatisfying the issue one repetition the comment entirely misunderstood you don say once and get saved you have receive faith first and this usually gained through daily recitation and deep listening investigating the teachings and your own reality when you really realize your bombu nature your inability help yourself that what opens your heart receive faith shin buddhism that moment your faith stabilized and frankly this faith should make you better person doesn just give you free pass let you disassociate something supposed allow you build and recognize fuller picture your own flawed reality you can really recognize and accept yourself warts and all that the moment you can begin change and change without overbearing sense guilt you might get from christianity and that what shin buddhism aiming you can recognize your faults how can you become better person but honestly think all these issues could have been avoided the author the comment had been familiar with other pure land schools like jodo shu mainland pure land rather than shin shin rather unique some its interpretations other school teaches that you will attain buddhahood upon rebirth and opinion the notion rather silly and contradicts pretty much the entirety buddhism other schools not place the emphasis one own inability that makes sound like you don need change have selfless love don think any these things interpreted the comment are truly part shin buddhism but they are common misinterpretations with the way commonly taught,1
excellent point keep mind that everything well mind exist within the buddha mind just the buddha exists within our mind people want know amitabha metaphorical concept for internal state being actual objective thing that exists somewhere his own realm existence the answer both trapped the prison eternity and the only limits our experience are what what can possibly conceived mind even though the hard limits our reality defined our experience existence during this lifetime may seem rather finite this only just our corner the sandbox there are numerous realms world systems universes etc assuming that see hear smell taste and touch here this planet the all end all limit what possible incredibly ego centric assumption akin early thinkers who assumed that the earth was the center the universe and the sun revolved around what know valid but the sum total human knowledge hardly the boundary what possible,1

are you asking how you can develop and send compassion toward other beings how you can feel you are receiving compassion from other,0
the buddhas and bodhisattvas are very compassionate towards like their only concern they can necessarily much about how our karmas ripen but they for sure cheer and they for sure offer shoulder cry where need one and they offer their blessing emotionally speaking the issue often not much whether the refuge jewels love but whether can open them enough touch that love bit touchy subject for many people least touchy word but prayer can helpful here there many traditional texts often recite this short prayer padmakara enlightened vision but you can course also pray your own words one teachers has suggested that shouting help will just turn the buddhas wordlessly just saying their name namo amituofo namo amituofo namo amituofo that actually complete path itself really they will answer even they had actually been answering already loooong before ever even thought ask,1

honest the bjp has done tremendous work myself have always been pro congress person the washington post just like new york times very anti india they keep posting opinions which always attack india some the things can point out road building and highway renovation has been its best under bjp new airports have opened bjp the only government have given fuck about the north east even though spending them doest reap political benefits the rise communal violence just propaganda there data otherwise communal violence happened during congress time and continues happen under bjp also rather crime rates have dropped the ease doing business has increased india which bound improve the fdi eventually the ujjwala lpg scheme has made sure the bpl people get subsidised gas connections people have returned their gas subsidy cause they don need subsidy gas don you notice the difference the cleanliness india all due swach bharat abhiyan atleast did when visited india year later open defecation has dropped drastically modicare legit and its nascant stages however bound develope into soemthing good the nhs beti bachao beti padhao super even though don see benefits right now will show results the near future any point that have written here based facts and not feelings hate that the liberals india argue based feelings and have data back please google any these and you are bound find gov released data for this not gov data will find non biased results also the who protector democracy has outright commented the way the bjp government has managed issues who unmf and the who who global economics have praised modi for his actions honestly speaking they are doing tremendous job and believe they should come power for just one more term will vote for congress the day the family business and monarchy ends cause india dictatorship and has been running like one under the gandhi family they have done great but their unoppposed status india very similar countries like north korea where politics family business,1
thank you very much gonna email you for that pdf,1
thank you add that there one buddhism each lineage and sect and tradition different that may more accurate call buddhisms edit this just opinion good joke that illustrates the diversity viewpoints get eight buddhists room and you have different opinions,1
live the western world and have over the past month only just begun study buddhism fascinated thank you for this post,0
thanks for asking this question have been wondering the very same thing for very long time well just turned couple months back and decided vote this year people are like modi govt this they did that but the thing congress didn’ anything great either and one thing for sure don’ want rahul gandhi running the country nothing personal ’ just don’ want someone who doesn’ know what ’ saying the most powerful man the country and apart from these two realistically there aren’ any other options ’ not pro bjp congress anything for that matters just want strong leader who knows what doing and the moment modi the only candidate who makes that cut someone has better option ’ ready change mind,1
create turmoil yeah little more than that demonetisation was big fail didn accomplish what was supposed and led many negative repercussions,1
this great just recently got into buddhism been going kadampa lineage center which more like buddhism for the modern people thought rebirth and reincarnation were the same thing thanks for clarifying,1
great stuff like your emphasis the fact that the buddha taught about alleviating suffering and nothing more ’ think ’ easy get caught the convoluted nature reality and consciousness and all that the beginning because ’ profound and new that point but ultimately goal help cease the suffering ourselves and others,1
thank you for sharing your thoughts and words really enjoyed and appreciated,1
thank you much for sharing this with rather new buddhism and haven’ quite gotten into these topics yet the temple currently attend have one question however that hope someone can answer our karma current conditions are based lifetimes merit then how are the chances being reborn human again extremely small this karma counting other kinds life forms may have lived apologize the answer obvious what not thanks advance,0
that was quite nice read thank you for sharing your konwledge,1
this great and exactly why joined this sub admittedly buddhism can bit intimidating especially for westerner threads like this are immensely helpful educating newcomers like myself thanks and everyone else here who shares their wisdom,1
this post and this whole thread has been very helpful thank you all for sharing your experience,1
hello would you kind and send digital copy you mentioned email dryadarbor thank you advance,1
thank you for this nice post just couple comments buddha not god sakyamuni buddha was man who through his own effort and accumulated merit was able rid himself his attachments and misconceptions probably add something here that the result this ridding was that wasn his own admission just man anymore according buddha taught how alleviate suffering nothing more that this not really true has been explained for example bhikkhu bodhi recently think just minor nitpick this case though all all what would personally add this perhaps after the bit about sutras the necessity learning from those who have walked and studied the path much more than did seems like people either think they can just rely authority figure and that they don need the foundations they can rely only text and don need contact with people favorite they don need either,1
what edition the dhp would you recommend someone who doesn’ own copy,1
many these points resonate with the ones that don are and even these teachings are true why are they taught seems that personally must have experience that verifies the existence other realms rebirth don understand the value having intellectual understanding these teachings someone tells valuable earn wholesome living sit meditation these intellectual concepts can put the test and can thereby move from intellectual understanding deeper felt understanding don understand how can test the idea rebirth seems that will just have continue practice and have experience that affirms this idea,1
very well put going you about copy the book,1
something ’ always struggled with since getting into this practice the human incarnation and the idea rebirth understand that this human form all have extremely rare and quite gift have heard the story the turtle spoken temple before far ’ aware humans are the only ones that can hear and understand the dharma this alone makes the human incarnation extraordinary after die the chances being blessed with another human incarnation anytime cycle soon unfathomable yet tibetan buddhism lama can not only incarnate human after death but also the same gender and within the same region the globe they’ not buddha they would not take form any living creature earth after death far know ’ aware that their knowledge the dharma unimaginably vast compared most but still confusing have yet read the tibetan book the dead which might give some insight into why this other schools buddhism believe this extraordinary method rebirth this just tibetan thing,1
great job mellowde writing this post help folks understand something that can difficult times grasp this not misconception but one important point that would emphasize people who might curious and who are more familiar with western abrahamic religions that fundamental implication buddhism that every being the buddha consciousness the difference lays whether human being recognizes this truth not one doesn have become buddhist recognize this but meditation and self reflection does help great deal developing mindfulness understanding reality and becoming more present life more than likely one will also come directly experience this state oneness with the buddha consciousness with all beings one practices the teachings whatever label choose put ourselves whether buddhist christian muslim hindu jewish taoist atheist agnostic meatbag human developing our wisdom and compassion will come perceive the world differently and will behave differently will think speak act and build habits accord with our understanding reality and accord with the love that inherently within the buddha consciousness will not become perfect beings and will likely not completely discard all self interest but will become more loving and compassionate towards each other make the choice digressing now but darwinian evolution can only taking living beings far after reaches point equilibrium between self interest and compassion and conscious being develops choice then the next step requires evolution consciousness which each being with the precious gift choice must choose undergo their own will order experience true bliss equanimity and unconditional love sidenote the experience oneness with all things the universe not just new age woo woo made concept there are neuro physiological explanations for why experience perception self oriented individuated consciousness opposed universal consciousness which believe the default state consciousness many you may have already seen jill bolte taylor famous ted talk stroke insight her story gives some insight into how our two brain hemisphere see reality differently theory that meditation allows gradually dissolve some these mechanisms which filter reality and create this illusory perception individuated self the self experience our normal waking state,1
seems like constitution that has unless feel like taking away clause not worth the paper written,0
india does not have absolute free speech and isn new india first jailed poet sultanpuri the poet who braved jail for insulting nehru for year because wrote poem criticizing him every government has been suppressing free speech since then some more than others this stems from the first amendment india constitution which put very broad category exceptions free speech nothing sub clause clause shall affect the operation any existing law prevent the state from making any law far such law imposes reasonable restrictions the exercise the right conferred the said sub clause the interests the sovereignty and integrity india the security the state friendly relations with foreign states public order decency morality relation contempt cour defamation incitement offence all the stuff bold are the exceptions where laws can made hinder free speech you can imagine very broad,1
please watch some raga recent interviews odisha interview opinion much more mature leader than modi speaks lot about taking everyone opinions into account talking with people disagrees with understand their perspective etc the things says make lot more sense and agree with them more than what hearing modi speaches also allows unscripted questions and even answers tough ones that are basically veiled insults your family hasn been able anything good for the nation why this amount freedom speech good and makes for much better discourse the congress today also announced that they floating the idea ubi universal basic income around which seems very cool india should the forefront innovative poverty reduction schemes since our country has such high population under the poverty line the world should learning from and testing out ubi would amazing for that here link video about what ubi course there lot reasons why should vote against modi but these were few reasons for why should vote for gandhi,1
have listened series interviews with tulsi and truly believe that she the best case scenario for 2020 she can depend support,1
seems like none your points are from your own experience but because having read from somewhere hearsay for these years but your seem confident,1
another huge misconception thinking that the buddha taught that there self this course mistranslation misinterpretation anattā the pāli word for self natthattā the suttas illustrate the buddha specifically put these questions self identification aside rather demonstrated how anattā was actually supposed gradually used end clinging all things hence the quote sabbe dhammā anattā dhp 279 ṭhānissaro bhikkhu explains this misconception,1
another really common misconception that buddhists pray buddha the same way christians pray god jesus that the jolly fat monk you see some mahayana temples buddha,0
simple take religion out bjp politics people may actually give them chance one always votes for the lesser evil and right now congress and group allies looks like the only alternative bjp has created environment the country where anyone who isn with them their viewpoint against them they don have franchise tell anyone for that matter whom pray what eat whose hands hold and whatnot they don want they most welcome practice that don impose others and you can just ignore demon gst and the countless attacks various institutions our country,1
currently have power centers modi shah and gandhis not good when power centers take voters for granted resulting corruption upa unilateral decisions demonitsation and taking control normally independent institutions this has happened both during congress and bjp times alternating power keeps both centers their toes the end not about who better but country making sure politicians don get complacent,1
matter what bjp aayegi because modi good orator get that didnt shit yrs but stuff like swaach bharat abhiyaan and make india were huge rahul cant pull something like this need have unique personality that and modi has one even though shit people will bring him again but this time there will huge shift are seeing other states too where the popularity bjp has gone down loottt don decide which party vote based these comments use the neta app see who contesting your area and what his rating,1
goddammit you guys not vote for any party just vote for the best local candidate please not subvert representative democracy like this don vote nota because has power just vote for local parties independents you find the leading party candidates corrupt don vote for known corrupt criminal people anyone else you vote for better than known corrupt criminal person really simple,0
this the best could make original politician jailed facebook post narendra modi 190128131746935 html reduced bot indian politician who posted picture prime minister narendra modi with begging bowl facebook has been arrested the latest example what critics say clampdown free speech sathiyaraj balu member local pro tamil party was arrested saturday after posted morphed picture modi with begging bowl day before the prime minister visit the southern state tamil nadu television reporter jail the northeastern state manipur for alleged posts that also criticised modi and the state chief minister biren singh extended summary 23autotldr and comments are monitored constructive feedback welcome top keywords modi arrests minister party prime,1
fair this isn something unique modi violation laws against slander any minister person thats publicly defamed can bring charges,1
nice summary question how you square with anatta the doctrine soul self thank you very much and best wishes for your practice,1
this was really interesting post read how would you describe the west’ view buddhism today,1
this sooms littlo ridiculous but will comply your torms,0
happy that havo startod this rovolution brothor connor,1
fortunately have the 1st amendment protect against this for now,1
free speech not freedom from consequences,1
found this post helpful and encouraging ’ never considered that there might difference between rebirth and reincarnation and think ’ fascinating thank you friend,1
hey dude really enjoyed your post and because the last couple years been interested western religion think this might the right time pick buddhism doesn bother you too much really apreciate you could send pdf what the buddha taught thanks lot gheorghita5570,1
was watching video from the pretty interesting religion for breakfast youtube channel talked about the prevalence true scotsman arguments discussing religion buddhists are nonviolent well here this example buddhist who did this that violent thing well they weren true buddhist hadn thought about before but lot discussion about religion goes this way there really are many variations buddhist practice and belief think the differences are greater from one end the other than the differences christianity and islam don know whole lot about but gather there great deal variety hinduism well,1
regarding karma appears that many people the west assume that karma cause and effect automatically means predictability cause and effect reminds scientific experiments where one effect follows the same cause during lots repeated experiments which why can predict the outcome certain causes with human actions quite different for one cannot easily repeat the same experiment with precise setting hundreds times but more importantly effects range from immediate and obvious deferred and very subtle personal solution try aware that words and actions have consequences not all which might able predict but useful try and act with best intentions that will increase the likelihood good outcomes,1
modi and shah successfully established fake news industry india and will have far reaching consequences political parties will come power and but everyone going use this the damage done,1
buddha not god correct buddha was not god buddha was superior the gods,1
this was such amazing breakdown found buddhism later life and now stuggle catch and understand this was great breakdown easy terms the basic concepts thank you,1
your incorrect buddha god was human before enlightenment yes but buddhas are divine figures who are worshiped the idea that they aren gods comes heavily from the fact that that the first major world religions summit the people chosen speak for buddhism were desperate make seem like modernist religion that was compatible with modern world views rather than old superstitious ones they tried translating way that seemed secular rather than mystical wasn really controversial call buddhas gods before this modernist interpretation spread and caught your issue semantics the terms rebirth and reincarnation aren objectively delineated this way english you can say that more meaningful translation would rebirth but translating reincarnation isn really strictly speaking wrong,1
don see why not long you are reciting the nembutsu does not matter what else you are doing,1
definitely fact there are least couple ways you could one way would coordinate each recitation with one breath then you using mala you would move forward one bead another way way that prefer fact coordinate one breath with recitations ymmv but for this usually means recitations the breath and recitations the out breath after one breath you move one bead forward this takes significantly longer one mala but the time you are done you have done 1000 recitations there are also many other things you can combine recitation with prostrations visualization listening the sound the recitation itself contemplation koan like who who now recites the buddha name and walking meditation fact you could even combine walking breathing and recitation the nembutsu very flexible practice experiment with and see what works for you,1
extremely important use our time wisely here the chances human rebirth not are extremely small what exactly does this mean how use our time wisely,1

aljazeera that interested free speech should first fight for home,1
there are few things unpack here was not journalist cartoonist common citizen who did was politician which defamation intent and for political gains not criticism free speech unless can established that member indian federal government issued the orders without fir arrest the person you cannot call suppression speech the government good journalist report would mention who initiated the action and for what reason instead broad brush strokes with accusatory connotations feed prejudiced mind shabby journalism like aljazeera bane our times,1
not start about monetization did create turmoil but did not put dark ages recession whatever you don really want answer and just like the government have made your mind and refuse collect data remember have idea about the extent impact partly because the government specifically stopped collecting data and partly because the informal economy hard keep track the gdp numbers you see assume the informal economy certain fraction gdp that assumption fails spectacularly situations like notebandi where the informal economy disproportionally affected,1
was actually with bjp and modi till demonitization knew that minorities would feel insecure under bjp and all the idiotic romeo squads will rise but they are bjp’ minorities and the party takes care them just the way congress tries its level best appease muslims modi was doing perfectly fine until went for demo then appointed yogiji the say what you want congress wouldn’ have interfered public life this way since then ’ one disappointment after another fuck modi and fuck bjp would love center right party but bjp right center social issues and left leaning financial issues that’ like the worst all worlds the way why shouldn’ talk about demo literally know people whose lives were uprooted because even though they had nothing with bjp,0

great post have somewhat different interpretation karma that struggle with because feel straightforward and true where everything have read complicated and unclear curious what folks here think experience has been that inner conflict and even doubt interferes with expression our thoughts and feelings the universe you ever have those times flow where your inner experience completely reflected the apparent “external” experience this seems times high coherence conflict and doubt will interfere how often you see somebody who you would think gosh how are they getting away with that would say they have conflict about maybe sounds like bit stretch but simple best can figure this compatible with what can make sense the concept buddhist karma and reduces very simple concept that may well not even concept simply you get out what you put careful and measured with what you put doesn’ depend any notion good bad right wrong but are not typically aware what’ lurking our not conscious and the effect practice make that more conscious and when are more aware can avoid doing things with conflict and doubt seems fit the model the path leading you “escape” karma but will not claim academic expert this just what have perceived own life and observing others trying reduce things much possible there nothing “believe ” seems more practical find something simple enough experience directly,1

most people here don realise that ambani babu will served regardless who has the power the center congress bjp sab ambani haath hai,1
guys the flip side the govt has just clarified the existing law both the companies knew from day that fdi marketplace allowed foreign companies can not own inventories multiple brand retail they were simply exploiting the loophole violating the law that another question now that loophole has been closed they can not come and cry hoarse that policy and rules are being changed whim they both are foreign firms can not hand over entire emerging sector them platter need have our own desi commerce firms otherwise decade when online shopping goes mainstream billions dollars will flowing out india,0
predatory pricing not good thing the long run for the consumers for small and growing companies they will not survive against these behemoths without some regulatory protection course the same laws should apply ambani venture,0
how long can sustain this damaging government hope the shame and distrust not stay forever,0
tbh making sure these commerce sites remain marketplace still better for the country long run the same time these rules should also applied domestic companies,1
this way too accurate,1
end raga jagah modiji hona chahiye tha that would have been realistic,1
\ cue india this month rolled out constraints foreign commerce players \ the tighter rules aimed protecting small traders may end benefiting the country’ richest man mukesh ambani \ the rules now bar amazon and flipkart online services pte from owning inventory and require them treat all vendors equally \ huge advantage homegrown companies including ambani’ new venture \ both amazon and walmart will have reduce cash back payments and discounts — sore point for smaller sellers who accuse the pair predatory pricing can rationalise this article whatsoever one hand says populist move aimed appeasing smaller retailers other hand also says that aimed benefitting reliance specifically,1

super,1
when entered this hobbie went the store and the first thing that the seller told actually that even more all the people asked for advice told that maybe not unpopular after all sorry for english not native speaker,1
get phone and you have your dac amp combo that good enough even for sennheiser hd800s,1
bought first tube amp and was able tell difference with the same pair headphones had for years they make iems sound better idk man think you already have few pairs headphones getting good amp can long way,1
classic circlejerk post,1
mostly happy with purplehearts running the dac although would like more power get the bass want without distorting the rest two things would like try out planar and tubes whatever can get more warmth and whump,1
with any technology upgrade the bottleneck first your computer has worse processor than your graphics card upgrading your graphics card won shit likewise for audio equipment you have shit headphones nothing will help them sound better,1
bought dragon fly red use with the feed with flac files can’ hear difference when use the iphone adapter and spotify premium,1
the only argument against this the headphone already matches your sound preferences the splurging dac and amp aren big deal that point for years was content headphone and wouldn splurging for the rest equipment,1
and people really really need and want amps and dacs for their cheaper headphones then getting modi dac with jds atom amp for that will easily hold you off until you’ ready upgrade your gear mean don even like this mentality gets you audibly transparent dac and amp there realistically reason upgrade unless you after certain features,1
bought the tin audio and spend any money other parts setup will long time from now want fully appreciate the difference that has already made even with standard smartphone dacs carry pixel the moment scared risking the possibility that there only much differentiation able notice want really enjoy the nuances this small investment have already unlocked edit guess updated source material too far favoring flac for good chunk collection that definitely important link the chain,1
dac amp sexier looking than headphones though obviously that why costs more,1
use rme adi dac with tin t2s come bro think part the reason because lot people this forum are also tech junkies love toys and just happens align somewhat with liking music one reaaalllyyy needs smartphones when the ones from even generations ago are just fine today but people want them anyway,1
would agree however you are not tight budget there are some mid headphones that benefit from better amp thinking specifically the hd650 and otl tube amps the diminishing returns for dac are much worse than amps since you won able hear the difference anyway you are this for the long haul here recommendation don spend more than dac partial the topping d50 you won able hear difference don buy bunch mid garbage consolidate and buy true end game headphone whatever that means for you like zmf great with tubes start with entry level amp like the jds labs atom when you can afford and you desire get better amp tube good match for your endgame headphone just know that the tube amp game bottomless money hole you that route again don buy bunch middle the road stuff straight the best you save more money since you will probably end there anyway you are like and have self control did mention like tubes tubes,1
very unpopular opinion,1
dac amp the idsd however due its features iematch bass analog sound processing usb power output that makes act battery bank could see people getting use with less expensive headphones the asp some voodoo phase shifting that doesn affect the and works many cases widen the soundstage with perceived degradation,0
how could you say something controversial yet brave,1
don see how this unpopular opinion you see this same advice from the few who actually try help headphoneadvice,0
they should make new tag called hot takes,1
agree but thx 789 looks pretty driving ear pods all seriousness people should just buy atom with whatever dac has the features that they want and they can have the best both worlds that being said bought 789 better drive k7xx and they but did not expect make dent the sen veil the hd6xx and did much that beigjng think that the amp xonar stx not operating spec think that the atom being fed decent 98db thd dac and any the mid headphones sweet spot that years ago could only had buying benchmark dac for lot more than,1
similar note see lot posts here where people buy gear then stream 320mbps spotify over honestly see more difference with uncompressed music cds flacs tidal deezer’ top tier over cheap hardware than compressed stuff over incredible hardware find baffling how people skimp the source was revelation going back uncompressed after 15years mp3s,1
usually tend spend about half what spent headphones the amp works pretty well,0
disagree once bought decent dac plus powerful and transparent amp can run any headphones want without having upgrade,1
well shit guess have get nicer headphones than hd660 thought 500 bucks would enough but guess not,0
even less popular opinion expensive headphones are next useless your source spotify and youtube computer onboard sound card,0

hell using audio dac with pair 58x and can deafening listening levels with zero distortion always tempted buy jds atom and grace design sdac but should probably just satisfied with what have already least until upgrade headphones,1
totally agree that headphones should the first upgrade point but have admit than when listening music from digital source even with cheap earbuds like have external amp just for the analogue feel volume control pot,1
whole heartily agree main setup audeze lcd mx4 and massdrop sdac may get something like mass drop thx aaa some day but think the differences will barely audible and could probably only tell abx testing,1
\ the best way increase your listening experience first upgrade your headphones then amplifiers and then finally dacs this completely standard opinion,1
totally makes sense would also add upgrading music file quality the argument make sure you streaming least 320 kbps flac,1
unpopular opinion one the most commonly stated things about upgrading gear ask nearly anyone this sub and they will tell you upgrade headphones first,1
really happy with emotiva 100 amp and fiio d03k dac connected chromecast audio planning stick with these components for long time probably get better headphones the near future currently using beyerdynamics 770 love the beyers though and can imagine other headphones sounding better but know there definitely better stuff out there,1
had hd6xx for year before getting dac and amp really had crank volume use them before the dac and amp massdrop sdac and have windows amp gain button most audio sources well works great most say the 6xx don work well for gaming but like them bit better than hd558,1
think this also depends the headphones totally case use easy drive cans and the difference between iphone’ included lightning and the oppo recently bought are limited slightly tighter bass slightly wider soundstage tiny bit more separation and bit more directionality with specific sounds such marbles hitting the ground “bubbles” yosi horikawa you can hear them drop certain direction more than with the 5mm lightning but feel like not carrying the oppo stupid dragonfly black with cck the 5mm lightning adapter does very good job and music still enjoyable unless close eyes and quier place can start nitpicking headphones make such bigger difference than amp dac device now imagine that were using cans that are way harder drive the lightning adapter even the dragonfly would show more difference but for cans with sub 40ohm resistance those devices are not critical unless you really are thinkung about some power hungry stuff you should first upgrade your cans and then get amp that can properly feed them,1
absolutely balls deep the middle claiming incredibly popular opinion and standard peice advice across the entire spectrum audio nerds and headfi enthusiasts unpopular and you somehow unique for having right not down voting for such shitty title game,1
with attention and devotion the meaning behind the word pronunciation prefer amituofo,0
arre vah uppar lungi state mein hain must need some guts lol,1
that not unpopular opinion ´ just fact the headphones will have the biggest impact sound quality and good amp will amplify the sound without distorting also use,1
whatever suits you amituofo chinese transliteration amitabha buddha omituofo regional dialect pronunciation amituofo amitabha sanskrit name amitabha buddha amitayus another sanskrit name amitabha buddha you may included the word buddha when you chant this name amitabha buddha amitabha buddha simply just say amitabha amitabha the chinese pronunciation ends with which means buddha itself amituofo includes the word buddha with already koreans say differently japanese any these ways are fine,1
stunning and brave wow controversial,1
each his own,1
the funny part about this the same truism for channel room audio spend most your budget the speakers this isn rocket surgery here get the most bang buck think the problem most people buy the headphones first with what they have then they have more money they don want upgrade the headphones they have they want add new gear because everyone likes adding new gear rather than replacing sell your old headphones give them friend and get something better first you follow the rules use for speakers with headphones your budget should about 3rd speakers and about 3rd preamp amp source device etc yes for everything else,1
this right ’ like people who buy reverb plugins but use condensers,1
entry level combo unit does okay job powering headphones after getting the 6xx and hearing that they scale well with better amp dac splurged for the 789 the atom dac would have been plenty upgrade but wanted more versatility and didn want amp dac being the thing holding back the next upgrade stage can imagine that will beyond elears lcd2 but time will tell atom dac didn seem like the huge leap upgrade over the current combo unit using well the atom would but going balanced with the smsl thx pairing gives more peace mind \ \ forgot where was going with this went straight those high end cans with the monoprice combo unit seems like bottleneck even going far saying just plug into mobo for awhile then upgrade from there would disservice while mostly agree with your stated sentiment there are upgrade plateaus same with any hobby really the atom 789 didn exist then yeah probably still plug elears into entry level unit,1
this seems like pretty popular opinion this sub,1
buddhism doesn care much about how this particular planet even this particular universe came the buddha did talk about some kind evolutionarily mechanism for humans once but that wasn for the sake giving precise answer such question anyway most buddhists familiar with the concept evolution and who know that science accept but doesn occupy big place their minds just like how for most other humans,1
amitābha the buddha did not discuss evolution however did teach that all phenomena are dependent nature not surprising that the evolution our species dependent the existence previously existing species and and forth the bottom line how does evolution the knowledge aid you your path nirvana doesn’ why spend time thinking,0
agree with this because pretty sure people who haven cross referenced lots headphones will able discern differences between dacs and amps which much more subtle difference,1
way looking phenomena but irrelevant analysis and maybe counterproductive dhamma,0

start with daily breath meditation lots basics marks existence ’ okay you have understanding any this start the teachings buddha largely build themselves many the teachings are interrelated take one thing time and open your awareness the most very basic teachings the most basic principle buddhism one skillful unskillful actions part your practice works for you then continue tool teaching causing your brain the point you lose the ability focus your breath meditation then let for right now you have the choice every present moment cultivate good intention even choose watch your breath this place strength for all the negative things accept what you cannot change accept that all negative things will pass everything changes everything,1
sādhu namo amitābha there are quite few books the subject think ‘what the buddha taught’ walpola always good primer lot’ good videos youtube recommend master shengyan the dharma drum series are great later when you’ start read sūtras you can check out the translations the ‘buddhist text translation society’ there’ great documentary narrated richard gere which gives good non sectarian summarization the buddha’ life best wishes all namo amitābha,1
also beginner serious buddhism but not meditation and would recommend that you definitely take serious practice one the benefits besides being able see your own and others patterns behavior more clearly and giving you space make better decisions that really developed compassion far listened jack kornfield buddhism for beginners audible which really touching and excellent and plan read thich nhat hanh the heart the buddha teaching which about the four noble truths and the noble eightfold path think those are going make excellent starting point sure more experienced and well read people will have great suggestions too,1

the science behind strong and the reasoning behind strong exists probably doesn have all that much with the teachings except very tangential way though evolution only really has religious association because protestant creationists,1

the entirety the dhamma rests the notion that death isn the end dukkha one will simply reborn one the thirty one existences depending their kamma explains that are here now because haven yet penetrated the four noble truths the belief that are eternally something nothing after death are told wrong view that doesn lead knowledge and insight your teacher right can see them for ourselves until awakening the buddha and the arahats did but can pay attention the teaching and processes dependent origination our lives and the causal connection between ignorance craving and the arising dukkha keep mind the buddha didn use the word reincarnation and instead always referred the process birth within the context dependent origination the fact that the causal chain continuously perpetuated living life through the lens ignorance birth gets repeated and becomes rebirth when the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid defilement pliant malleable steady attained imperturbability directed the knowledge recollecting past lives recollected manifold past lives one birth two five ten fifty hundred thousand hundred thousand many eons cosmic contraction many eons cosmic expansion many eons cosmic contraction expansion there had such name belonged such clan had such appearance such was food such experience pleasure pain such the end life passing away from that state arose there there too had such name belonged such clan had such appearance such was food such experience pleasure pain such the end life passing away from that state arose here thus remembered manifold past lives their modes details knowing this important because apparently not only the way things really are but will help become disenchanted with this one body and sense self people who are stronger attached will more easily susceptible ignorance and all the dukkha that inevitably follows,1

understand what you mean here and sure that the common people pakistan themselves suffer from terrorism but very difficult believe that the govt military has role the attack the past they categorically denied the fact that india did fact conduct surgical strikes the indian govt had proof and the pakistan govt military still weren ready believe that they had terrorist training centres and launch pads their country when you say that actually getting involved the attack might harm pakistan status quo find difficult believe almost every time they used these methods smoke screens very well turn out same case this time too just have wait until the reports come and prove which one correct,0
first all thank you for taking this initiative think most indians don consider ordinary pakistani citizens evil intentioned are angry your governments and the military isi establishment with that said alternative warfare facepalm recent times the government has been trying its best resume dialogue with india there the kartarpur corridor that the government really trying push hard every single time there possibility improved relations between the two countries terror attack immediately takes place probably much older you and have been seeing this pattern for long time allow present perspective pakistani you know how your military dominates the nation often said that other countries have army but pakistan the army has country the military very influential civilian government can afford against its wishes not only that the military controls pakistan foreign relations particular its policy towards india top that the military has business interests every sector your economy why does have much power because seen critical for pakistan survival seen the only thing standing between pakistan and its evil neighbour india our countries achieved lasting peace the importance pakistan military would decrease since pakistanis won consider themselves under constant threat they would question the need have such outsized and influential army budgets would reduced privileges might curtailed for the military this would loss its power and influence and that certainly won the army and the isi control the militant groups you admitted much your alternate warfare comment any time they want terror attack take place they can issue the orders and this that happens every time peace has chance the pakistani military establishment orders terror attack nip the bud 423 this evil and cynical not only that hypocritical pakistan claims represent pre 1947 india muslims frequently raises concerns about real and imaginary troubles indian muslims but carrying out terror attacks like this has only been strengthening the hands radical right wing hindutva groups pakistan has given them paintbrushes paint all muslims terrorist sympathizers has given them ammo attack liberals and centrists soft terror any indian who tries say anything positive about pakistan such considering pakistan view point labelled anti india anti national etc you are making things extremely hard for peace loving indians and extremely easy for right wing hawks trolls and goons and finally this also short sighted the age 24x7 news channels and social media outrage easy create and sustain search eyeballs and advertising revenue the channel hosts try outdo each other sensationalism and emotional hooks the result that our citizens get whipped into frenzy every time there terror attack eventually one day when there even bigger terror attack imagine 1000 dead the hysteria will much that the government would forced take military action when that happens surgical strike can escalate into war you know india has superiority conventional forces what would happen pakistan starts lose your military has already been humiliated once 1971 and another loss would completely unacceptable them they would likely use nukes against india that could easily escalate into nuclear holocaust south asia where india would severely damaged but pakistan would completely wiped out 128,1
pakistan ideology not parallel nation this thing kashmir old civil war going pakistan really not separate nation the end the day indians not detest pakistanis people born the territory today known pakistan but pakistan the anti india your sorrows and sympathies with indians because deep down you probably not peace with pakistan the ideology itself india needs dismember the terrorist state pakistan for peace south asia and the world pakistan was basically puppet state hoisted departing anglo american world order keep south asia under the thumb india can peace with independent republics sindh west punjab even kashmir and have usa canada style relations with each the nations but not with pakistan understand though you are coming from place love the end the day you can only speak for yourself and not all pakistanis and definitely not for pakistan individual individual thank you,1
boy understand the sentiment behind your post most understand that normal bloke going about his daily life pakistan not responsible for shit like this all understand you people too but you gonna come here try defend the pakistani government and the shit they then yeah don think you feel very welcomed here take firm decision from our side put all the fuckery pakistan been doing rest once and for all and this point not really particular about collateral damage hope the indian government does just that can friends our countries cannot yours has done everything possible make sure that the case that being said thank you for your empathy have good one,1
posted some parts comments below the original thread and was downvoted hell because people were angry but let explain how not only pakistan but you average pakistani responsible too first off you are right that the pakistani government may not gain much out this particular terror attack your country the fatf greylist for failing curb terror financing this attack going used against you when comes the decision blacklisting pakistan but let talk about the the pakistani economy and the army the economy crumbling and imran khan doing good job trying resuscitate parts includes getting more austere far expenses are concerned imran khan came off the support the army and has far not touched their budget but what happens and when things dire further the army does not want that plus the election season india and rahul gandhi mayawati not the same kind demon that pakistanis can see modi the army needs modi back and whoever financed this attack well knows that this one going get people more nationalistic here and vote for the bjp this helps your army drum more fear and ensure that matter how shit the economy turns out their budget untouched even raised further now coming the topic this attack the attacker was local mason doubt about that unlike pakistan did with kasab india hasn failed acknowledge his citizenship but 350 kilogram explosives costs money tons where does poor mason get this money come from has pledged allegiance pakistan based jem jem banned where they get money finance such expensive terror attack organization like jem would given chance blow indian cities all day but given that they chose this particular time execute attack you should consider who chooses benefit from this mentioned above your army the tax you pay honest citizen goes your defence budget and part this makes way through the explosives that were used for this terror attack,1
masood azhar may have been pakistan some point but jaish mohammad banned here and yes these groups are capable planning and carrying out activities their own why know that grew pakistan decade terror lives pakistan jaish mohhamad and let are based pakistan those are just facts this request bring logic and reason into the argument time did that for change both sides the border pakistan has more lose from this attack than you realize had lot lose from sheltering bin laden from protecting hafeez saeed from blocking labelling masood azhar terrorist still did that the problem jem was indeed banned when they started attacking pakistan the snakes the backyard approach indeed dangerous pakistan does lose lot nurturing snakes your country still happens for facts you should read the actual direct literature let and jem there lot independent proof that they are being promoted the isi for let even clearer most let recruites are from punjab pakistan not kashmir,1
indian finance minister arun jaitley press briefing said that modi cabinet had decided initiate steps ensure complete diplomatic isolation pakistan what became diplomatic isolation after 2016 uri attacks report from 2016 tjyxpb5msklz8u6ws9v4im html india readies response uri attack plans diplomatic isolation pakistan think india this point with such cringe inducing statements only embarrassing itself their power and clout nowhere near where they imagine they can probably minor nuisance countries like nepal but even that changing moves bring nepal into its sphere influence 3661636 hope they make sequel uri though movie that bad that its good,1

masood azhar may have been pakistan some point but jaish mohammad banned here what your source for this because believe that azhar very much living pok and china also saying that pakistan would ban this organization only india provides enough evidence azhar and jem are definitely not banned there pakistan defends terrorist masood azhar justifies its veto indias move united nations 1924157 while respect your condolences individual pakistan citizen cant help but feel fuck pakistan govt this time,0

look anyone with half brain will not blame the average pakistani citizen but your country straight cultivated the terror groups way warfare post 1971 where was understood that conventional warfare will not possible dent hole into india your politicians your military has cultivated this atmosphere and ultimately the same groups have grown out control and have targeted your citizens masood azhar being banned means nothing when you know that isi going cultivate him and his ilk for unconventional warfare,0

this the same kind excuse german made when hitler rose power the weimar republic are just normal german who want get along with our lives and have nothing with the nationalist socialist party nazi party the excuse the soldiers gave during the nuremberg trials that were just following orders pakistanis individually may not responsible but group they are blame mean look any terror organisations chances are has heavy presence pakistan with access the higher ups the social strata for example jem may banned organisation the leader jem has security given your army and the same goes for other designated terrorists,1
won deny that pakistan hasn been involved alternative warfare before 10th the size india with largely inferior defense machinery our forces probably deemed the only way keeping the indian advances check you truly not support terrorism suggest you avoid using terms like alternate warfare and justifying when your country doing just makes your entire post sound like load crap,0
\ askindia\ this particular terror attack seems have affected the psyches many ordinary citizens far more than others for example just now some association local senior citizens took procession around our roads condemning pakistan shouting bmkj vande mataram etc local called news channels bangalore are milking this attack the hilt the whole day hard hitting visuals combined with sentimental songs like mere watan logo and other patriotic kannada songs playing the background lot discussions about war and revenge and course tonnes ads between many traumatized discussions here reddit this sub and others what can need some answers now etc did not see this level nationwide trauma protests processions during 2008 when number deaths were far higher and far closer the ordinary citizen than this attack more recent years did not see such protests after the uri attack 2016 army casualties the sukma naxal ied attack 2017 crpf casualties question simple why you think has this particular terror attack affected our society this much,1

its nice how indians comments are getting deleted and some guys are maintain biased environment,1
the fact terror groups will always thrive pakistan due the very nature that country their own internal life shambles due the same terror elements wiping out pakistani terror objective should modified “ wiping out terror elements within india borders” surgical strikes across border will only create costly distractions these elements are well blended inside pakistan society how are you gonna isolate them and target them within pakistan surgical strike the most stupid thing ever heard you can take blurry video any place and claim its strike more than military force should masive surge intelligence elements raw whoever needs recruit spies informants within native kashmiri’ easier said than done planting spies and informants within populace slow process,1

time for modi use the significant amount political soft power leverage and diplomatic goodwill that acquired his international travels this entire term persuade other world states economically sanction pakistan pressure government cut off isi funding for external unconventional warfare and increase its accountability its citizens the unfortunate fact the matter that the civilian government there barely has exercises any control its military headed intelligence agencies that have purposefully created external terror outfits which allows the presumption the likelihood that imran khan govt most likely had knowledge that the isi backed jem planned and executed this attack however his refusal reign his own generals out fear military coup does definitely put him some indirect culpability encourage the convince khan’ government work together find way get his military external agencies and paramilitary forces firmly under his control carrot and stick approach simultaneously the same time let’ not pretend that responsibility this attack solely falls external agents the car bomber deliberately targeted crpf bus not ordinary civilians but the very state force that has been implicated and explicitly failed hold responsible its members committing very serious amount human rights abuses kashmiris for over two decades with accountability checks from the indian govt the very actions that fuelled this anger india unwilling keep its forces under check lose any credibility for moral outrage call this unprovoked attack increase internal overchecks the forces there develop trust between them and the kashmiris stop supporting baloch separatists and eventually work with khan’ government solve this issue once and for all instead playing tit for tat with them for the next couple decades,0

important remember that the pakistan and the army operate separately and history very good indicator that this means that often times there collision interest between the two sides but the end the day the military establishment has always had the more power and the final say things this explains why jem banned pakistan but not eradicated also explains why good relationship with neighboring countries always suggested hinted pakistan but never materialized would also like add that the oppressed minorities pakistan are aware the army problem and are just sick and tired anyone else but their voices are suppressed,1
much appreciated,1
all have die today tomorrow only the most valiant people get the chance sacrifice their lives for india yes miss them and are sad but aren afraid they killed our soldiers scare into giving kashmir india place billion people they can kill all they can scare all dont give into their scare tactics giving kashmir pakistan not solution soldier job protect the country and even their deaths they protected our civilians our army doing its job very well,0

sorry this stupid but how the officials know that adil dar carried out the suicide bombing was the jeep his body must have turned ashes how did they recognize him,0
pulwama attack was colossal security failure why action against any officer agency yet not even reprimand there must some accountability from our side too the job jem paki army isi etc bleed with thousand cuts and they are doing well why can properly protect ourselves these terrorists kill our soldiers our secure base camps pathankot nagarkota uri and now pulwama our soldiers are killed mercilessly before avenge them must cover our loop holes,0
was thinking instead going offensive why not take defensive stance mean going offensive will just cycle attacks and deaths would investing heavily armour and real tight security sensible like make india imprenetable for this case the buses transporting the soldiers was blast proof would have reduced the death count right,0
feel the only ways solve this issue will stealthily attacking jem and other similar terrorist groups pakistan know isn piece cake but have the required skills pull this off mean pakistanis say pakistan isn fault here but let honest pak has rat infestation problem and just trying help them out with and now thinking about kashmir really want 370 scrapped want kashmiri people come down other states more talk other indians get better opportunities see all india has offer have better life because all know kashmiri brethren will better off indian kashmiris rather than pakistanis independent kashmiris,1

had quite number interactions with kashmiris over past few years since dad traveled bit his heydays and certainly lot more after this attack and the thing heard moderate kashmiris say that they dont hate india the people india they hate the indian army and the indian politics kashmiris have told number things like how these terrorists are smuggled after paying quite bit moolah the right person how order from higher officials and politicians our forces pick kashmiri youths and kill them grounds them being militants know this slightly over reaching and out there but think about this isn the first time this would happened history the section atrocities powerful armies maybe guys this the time strike down those terror camps pak and retrospect what done with kashmir the same time,0
this far the most sane discussion this attack every where else social media could see plain hatred and bad words without thinking about consequences need stabilize situation between the two countries lot political agenda involved due upcoming elections india going war will lead more deaths stopping trade etc know what current government capable even there chance they are involved this massacre and ill condition kashmir the educated public india should try and sort things out,0

thank you and welcome that lot great information for our site here much appreciation bit much digest all once just pick through here and there for starters nichiren states “…bodhisattva superior practices will certainly appear and establish the object devotion the first 500 years the latter day the law” the latter day the law started 1500 nichiren couldn have been who though was because miscalculated such are the dangers bad math nichiren lived about 200 years before the beginning the latter day the law which means that nichiren was wrong about everything fact nichiren acknowledged much the end his life hut seven feet height but the snow outside piled depth ten feet surrounded four walls ice and icicles hang down from the eaves like necklace jewels adorning place religious practice while inside hut snow heaped place rice far from attaining buddhahood this present life like the cold suffering bird longer shave head look like quail and robe gets stiff with ice that resembles the icy wings the mandarin duck such place where friends from former times never come visit where have been abandoned even own disciples you have sent these vessels empty dishes which heap with snow imagining rice and from which drink water thinking gruel nichiren some buddha,1

think going get downvoted this but hear out anyway only thinking out loud don think have enough leverage over pakistan make them reconsider their strategy funding terror groups thinking what happened because then effectively used aided the mukti bahini counter pakistan certainly has well oiled machinery going for itself kashmir that they been actively using against and until have something similar that could use against them don see how could negate their strategy don blame just the current dispensation for not having leverage over pakistan not sure what people make comments but for cmv discussion with anyone who might interested just teenager feeling way around geopolitics,1
why everyone saying that india should war with pakistan not that simple sounds there are lot diplomatic issues involved even war declared not without bloodshed both the sides pakistan has large enough army give good fight they decide fight back that india victory not guaranteed and stop with the bulls like russia will support india china will support pakistan this not some classroom fight with countries choosing the sides which they want even the war breaks out will trigger domino effect and will eventually lead ww3 stop speculating start thinking logical sense war not the answer instead diplomatic war would best bet weaken pakistan try sanction them cut off their supply lines thank you for reading expecting lot downvotes just putting voice out,1

just shut and follow ikeda “that the way practice correctly” shintaro ishihara diet member grandson died truly would have been alright hadn but buddhist punishment for slandering ishihara thought was fool despised and tried make fool anyone who meets gains fortune anyone who betrays antagonizes will fall into hell this the severe law buddhism remember that well all ikeda own words nichiren’ “standard proof” “doesn’ apply daisaku” “ the sensei” leader permitted acquire following his own for would divisive incursion into president ikeda prerogatives supreme leader source forget about raising successors and the next generation ends with ikeda whatever and the say and print are true “that mindset must cease” this something that work toward here the ikeda worship which ikeda himself promotes truly disgusting gotten infinitely worse since the nichiren shoshu priesthood excommunicated ikeda and removed his dumb cult from their list approved lay organizations take look daisaku ikeda the world’ foremost authority nichiren buddhism source that what found over one the sgi many vanity presses paid for the sgi members donations which exists only publish things written others that daisaku ikeda name rubber stamped can pretend author all the cult leaders self publish via their own culty little vanity presses why should daisaku ikeda considered the world foremost authority nichiren buddhism never completed any formal course study never been tonsured has credentials whatsoever even people the real world don consider him legitimate scholar examination soka education necessitates reiterating its virtual unfamiliarity academic and educational circles outside japan therefore any critical analysis soka comes with the proviso that great deal what has been written about this approach its principal proponents currently inaccessible for broad based study the chief reasons for this are twofold firstly neither makiguchi toda nor ikeda are regarded scholars any traditional sense they were not university educated formally trained academics and therefore their essentially makiguchi’ and toda’ publications were largely relegated relative obscurity japanese educational spheres source 2016 1138575 credentials matter outside cult leader little cult personality there are plenty priests nichiren priests who have been studying everything nichiren and lotus sutra since their teens who have devoted their entire careers and lifetimes the study these teachings while daisaku ikeda has instead chosen jet setting lifestyle paying various people meet with him sit for photo that will then played like was some big deal daisaku ikeda has never shakubukued single person even apparently simply being the top authoritarian the soka gakkai organizations makes him default the world foremost authority the three top theoreticians the gakkai the supreme theoretician course president ikeda followed probably kodaira yoshihei toda convert member parliament general administrator and the head the study department supreme theoretician simply the prerogative the topmost authoritarian the dictatorship pyramid sure sounds like that the award you win for seizing the presidency hmm little could anyone have ever imagined that when ikeda was born would mentor leader peace activist and truly one the greatest humans that has ever lived source one the greatest humans that has ever lived wowzers who said humility and modesty had any place within true buddhism remember ikeda permitting this sort grotesque hero worship not outright designing everyone sgi should embarrassed this naked preening and self glorification why should ikeda considered the supreme theoretician anyone can say that where the actual proof where the evidence that ikeda does fact possess the requisite qualifications where are ikeda credentials what legitimate study program has ikeda completed dropped out community college his very first semester ikeda has nothing and yet the sgi members are supposed believe that this greedy grasping little man who has only ever sought power and wealth somehow more knowledgeable than the priests who devoted themselves study and practice for entire careers and even lifetimes obscene scandal this not buddhism this one hopelessly insecure little man quest for immortality ikeda bound for oblivion just surely any other person who has ever existed eternity will not remember his name anyone source and what about actual proof ikeda favorite son died age stomach ailment that rarely fatal for all his efforts ikeda has failed awarded the nobel peace prize all ikeda jibbajabba about making the impossible possible sure looks like empty words doesn ikeda can make work when has the luxury devoting every moment every day what chance you have making work and what about world peace than when toda recreated the soka gakkai after wwii things have been getting better anywhere the world thanks the ikeda cult ikeda and his dumb cult are useless all this worship daisaku ikeda isn doing anyone bit good except for daisaku ikeda course how demeaning being nothing more than chorus member sing the praises one self important little swine man that all the sgi members exist for what about ikeda life worth emulating has friends hasn been able shakubuku single person everybody japan hates him doesn even have any grandchildren his own family completely broken ikeda nothing but vampire who thinks can suck away everyone else life force and money and thus live forever,1

just yesterday was cynically thinking about how overhyped and ineffective the surgical strikes were the long run because the armed forces stopped after just one while the terror attacks kept coming this dwarfs the post uri strikes scope and fitting answer india needs this regular basis send pakistan message credit the iaf for planning and executing and for modi doval for approving given the normally cautious and dove ish tendencies indian strategic planning this would not have been imaginable under any previous administration since rajiv gandhi,0
indian govt should release more info because now its our word theirs,1
finding hard establish the true sequence events just woke all this over pakistan they linked some times article saying that there wasn specific target and was more for show add that people citing political motivation light upcoming elections there has also been some mention air force office involved committing suicide indian media seems going tow with reports all the terrorists killed what exactly going even this thread getting confusing possible could some one provide credible and verified sources information can establish what unanimously confirmed least independent sources outside india and pakistan,1

have probably watched dozens hours worth combat footage from the last nearly two decades war afghanistan syria and iraq and don’ recall ever reading about these many casualties single strike can’ help but feel bit skepticism that eliminated many 300 terrorists one blow when don’ recall air strike against qaeda daesh isil yielding such high casualties one swift operation see bunch hysteria social media already and people are celebrating this like champions league final far can tell they knew exactly what they were doing throwing out that 200 300 number,1
3rd party perspective both nyt and jazeera are both suggesting this could been former camp site and that nothing significant was hit hopefully both sides can stick their narratives and this doesn have escalate india can say they got win while pakistan can deny and not have retaliate,1
few dots could connect far multi hundred body count after the pulwama attack pakistan must had anticipated another attack terrorist launch pads pok near loc therefore they emptied those launch pads and took all terrorists camp inside pakistan they must though that india which wary entering pok airspace would enter pakistani airspace too bad for them that india did the unthinkable after they assembled all them one camp also people are forgetting that there were jets and three attack locations comes around jets per attack location and each jet can carry couple thousand kilograms ordnance burnt patches land the mirages flew from gwalior carrying full battle load 1000 kms away assuming that they flew straight line they must carried fuel tanks with them now don know they jettisoned them before after delivering the bomb payload and pretty obvious that those small burnt patches vegetation were not result massive bombs because they would created proper craters pakistan interests that they deny this attack for multiple reasons some them are jets flew into your territory bombed the shit out you and flew back unscathed rather than admit that you failed you can simply say such attacks happened they admit that attacks did happen then would equal admitting that there was jem camp there which would startling news for lot pakistani citizens and they would lose face internationally especially when they are seeking bailouts from imf they admit being attacked pakistani soil then their citizens would pressurize them retaliate and against whom will they retaliate and how against indian forces and through regular actors that could result their ass handed them further escalation via terrorists pakistan would admit that they sent terrorists india attack that confession like never seen before and lastly shame indian citizens who trust pakistan word more than your own government,0
tbh feel government india should release some satellite picture before and after the attack for proof the public because this feels like stunt before the election ppl that say they dropped 1000kg worth bombs hence terrorist must there have keep mind that those 1000kg bombs were spread out and had large area impact they were free falling from large height the matter fact such action whether right wrong can very devastating for everyone not done acc last viable option,1

think the narrative has gotten twisted lot here due some smart pakistani action first all this the first time the iaf has been used respond provocation the pakistani army against india even 1999 kargil the iaf din cross the and this time they crossed not just the but the international border itself pakistan however doesn want escalate the conflict yet also needs save face therefore they smartly controlled the narrative twisting the argument from india violating their sovereignity the efficacy the action now the argument came down whether 200 300 terrorists were killed rather than the fact that india has raised the cost for pakistani army support terrorists immeasurably earlier pakistan could use nuclear shield train and launch terrorists with impunity whereas now india has shown pakistan that they can infiltrate deep they need within pakistan destroy the terrorists iaf easily went till dropped payload and then waltzed back out without suffering single scratch they did this when the pakistani army and air force were ostensibly high alert and they attacked from the theater pakistan was preparing defend this shows that their nothing pakistan can stop any such incursions the future too besides behave themselves ultimately even killed 200 terrorists wouldn matter usa has been droning pakistanis for ages and still losing afghanistan the message that india has sent pakistan much more important than the number terrorists killed not that all debating whether the mission would succeed with 200 deaths 300 deaths just some smart psychology the pakistanis the fact the mission has already succeeded,1
this entire affair just cynical electioneering from both sides the isi wants the bjp win good for pakistan more precisely put the pakistani establishment hindutva rises makes the looming economic recession pakistan easier bear you can fall back saber rattling distract the people you need someone willing baited easily and the bjp more than willing dance along the bjp have their own problems with employment creation which they manifestly failed with they are more than happy tag along this escalating nonsense even the domestic economy remains disappointing,1

western security officials have raised questions about the existence large scale training camp saying that pakistan longer runs such camps and that militant groups are spread out small groups around the country analysts and diplomats new delhi said the targets the indian airstrikes were unclear any terrorist groups operating along the border would have cleared out recent days after prime minister narendra modi india vowed retaliation over the kashmir attack “what they hit speculation for now — they say they hit terrorist camp but lot intelligence sources say those camps pakistan had been cleaned out recent days ” bedi said “this more political symbolism than anything else modi had show some demonstrable action india’ part ahead elections ” “the pakistanis are bound react conventionally and not through proxy like militant group ” said rahul bedi analyst the london based jane’ information group which tracks the defense industry “where they react and when something that only pakistanis know this dangerous situation this brinkmanship can escalate quickly ” inka maja nikalain gay hum inshaallah,1
can please have copy friend live out sorry,0
this whole thing was drama calm their public down they achieved that this ends the attacks muslims and kashmiris inside india say good now let all calm down,1
the issue that paki intelligence did not know anything about this chalo khair lekin asal masla paki side could also not hit these airplanes which might indicate that paki radars could not detect them pak military needs upgrade their game,0
hey man may have been sodomized death with bayonet but least won oscar for best pictrue,1
was watching geo news and the anchor was telling that many journalists from india are questioning the authenticity the strikes and they showed this tweet example was not surprised,1
they struck pak territory not pok this huge kudos iaf,1
don know what believe the moment both indian news channels and pakistani news channels lol seem very biased can anyone provide some genuine report confirming what has happened,1
plan was not cross loc but due weather conditions they had source print from the article top defence sources told theprint that the five mirage 2000s were backed more fighter aircraft the same kind along with number sukhoi mkis mid air refueller and two airborne warning and control system awacs the strike began and lasted minutes also was pretty full blown operation and india was expecting paf response,1
don care not even single person was killed but thing went into the pakistani territory and came back unscathed pakistan stays silent would only embolden try this again not nationalist any definition but don like haath haath rakh baethna,0
how quickly can get nukes maduro,1
one thing want point out have killed about 900 militants the last years there body count 100 also means that half year worth militants are dead,0
indian response passes this test based intelligence further jaish attacks india the terms anticipatory self defense preemptive self defense and preemption traditionally refers state right strike first self defense when faced with imminent attack,1
take air strike all you are fighting whether the bombs struck terrorists not whether 200 300 arbitrary number etc but what you fail understand how meticulously india changed the whole game you look pakistani reaction they are all charged how iaf could breach their airspace they now want pak airforce army retaliate now paf have terror camps strike india and they strike civilian army location they are responsible for escalation and needles say they something stupid india gonna rip them apart and there nothing could about edit feb fuckers have balls gotta give them,0
must also appreciate diplomatic angle played govt the only official statement about this attack came from ministry external affairs mea and not ministry defense pmo any other military unit and that too with subtle definition these strikes non military preemptive strikes which mean that strikes were not meant against any civil military targets pakistan but against globally recognized terrorist organisation and these strikes were self defense and not any retaliation this cunning statement pretty much check mates pakistan and bring legitimacy and global support for our actions now unless pakistan can find non military non civil target which could harm them pakistan cannot legitimately retaliate,0
this true plain don know anymore,1
but gaddafi def didn have nukes right,1
that misquote this was actually said ron paul tulsi still shit,0
just going ignore the popular rebellion that broke out,1
1000 bombs lol they just burnt some trees pakistan everyone,1
’ love see her secretary defense sanders administration,1
good for you awesome setup,1
the strike happened pak sovereign territory yes putting aside both side claimed whether terrorist site not simple basic fact that iaf bomb pakistan sovereign territory what pak retaliated and bomb india sovereign territory will india counter that and also retaliated tit for tat until become full scale war will india response the same this the next time such tragedy happened again will pak also respond such today when their territory bomb again,1
great job iaf,1
cents the bombing iaf there were planes and thousands pounds bombs dropped balakot surely have some videos pictures those areas from the general public pakistan shit like this can hidden would have been first the mic had actually done something like this why are every sources ours still mumbling over this while ispr has given clear version why didn the paf shoot the aircraft down miles nothing airwarfare shoot down retreating jet and the debris will farther than miles and into our own territory giving rise claims the offender that they were their own territory but still they have 10km buffer zone place should tracking well within their border this just for domestic consumption little incursion you know pakistan won shoot beat the drums surgical strike and 200 killed bla bla bla and you got the elections one public asking for proof just celebrating like won everything govt should provide proof did indeed drop those munitions else all this just another jumla kaka for the impending election and not anty nashnol for thinking rationally and asking for proof,1
key extracts from piece the new york times pakistan kashmir airstrikes html residents around balakot the scene the attack pakistan said they saw sign any significant damage from the airstrikes the view that little had been damaged was supported military analysts and two western security officials who said that any militant training areas the site the pakistani province khyber pakhtunkwha had long since packed dispersed earlier reports had placed the attack the pakistani side kashmir which nearby resident attar shisha village inside pakistan about miles from balakot said was woken loud explosions about tuesday was reached phone and asked remain anonymous out fear reprisal the pakistani authorities the villager said that jaish mohammed still ran school balakot but that the airstrikes missed the facility and hit empty ravine instead adding that there were casualties had heard balakot and its surrounding area hosted numerous militant training camps until 2005 when powerful earthquake struck the area devastating its towns and villages international aid groups poured provide relief militants packed their camps and went elsewhere avoid being detected analysts say “what they hit speculation for now — they say they hit terrorist camp but lot intelligence sources say those camps pakistan had been cleaned out recent days ” bedi said “this more political symbolism than anything else modi had show some demonstrable action india’ part ahead elections ”,1
meanwhile pakistan can even get back reconnaissance drone back safely,1
now that india has accomplished the mission the best course action would downplay public and global front and let imran khan save face there lot pressure him retaliate which could lead full blown war the military could again have coup and get into power both cases are extremely bad for india better not tease the pakistanis too much like some moronic journalists are doing right right now those videos would public youtube and unite pakistan against india meanwhile india should keep the pressure private and communicate that this not isolated case would the course action after every future terrorist strike that might happen,1
tfw you throw 1000kg bomb ultra sneakily which costs fortune only destroy trees,0
what people calling for all out war need realize that even though india have military naval and aerial superiority both countries have nuclear warheads which massive equalizer and could used pakistan last ditch effort posing great threat the whole our country,1
learned never trust what government has say because they can always manipulate news and fabricate stories please don’ fall trap the stories and pundits who are just delving conspiracies make quick buck one should able critically analyze the evidence and able critically think before rushing the conclusion,1
bbc confirmed that there 200 300 killed pakistan the pakistani media definitely burst out and there 100 possibility start the war this happened don trust the indian media they exaggerated the news iaf claims that they killed 200 300 militants but pakistan govt army and media denied each and everything lets talk the facts basis and ask the iaf prove more over they doped the heavy payload pakistan iaf also give our iad tech pakistan wtf,0
good article for quick,1
amazing that iaf was able accomplish such clean cut strike foreign air space swiftly and stealthily with civilian casualties and little none responsive action from pakistani armed forces really impressed with the strategic abilities our air force however concerned about the aftermath the strike being reported can come conclusion the result find many conflicting announcements try unbiased possible and usually check out international media for news and now there clear concensus whether the strike killed large number terrorists not think the death ustad ghouri announced vijay gokhale will play major role validating our statement also think time will see clear picture and somewhere between what and pakistan are claiming let see meanwhile can you link any sources which you think can clear this out for,1
was lurking pakistan they got point that killing 300 people huge thing must reflected local news paper social media but such thing not reported thr may should wait for tomorrow coz local newspaper cover such things may was safety valve govt coz even after pulwama many soilder died various encounter lot anger among indian youth,1
kudos iaf army intel for poking the eye when was looking out that said the technical narrative very interesting seems multiple iaf squadrons were dispatched across pak borders mirage 2000 aircrafts entered pak air space carry out the attack mirage 2000 though capable multirole not capable defending against pak f16 obviously some the mirages were defending the bombers even then they are not match for f16 either sukhoi role the operation not being mentioned for some reason sukhoi aircrafts didn enter pak air space media have been reporting that f16 came contact with the iaf squadron but backed off seeing the size iaf squadron which makes the case only aircrafts even more dubious also though 1000kg bomb like drdo glide capable producing casualties range 100 theory practical only all them were close range several those bombs might more likely for producing high casualties claimed media again only all them were same location,1
has been confirmed that actual terrorists have been murdered not civilians checking the pak subreddit shows that human was injured they say can someone update what the current situation,1
nuclear umbrella develops leak since the pakistani nuclear tests pakistan military has operated under the presumption that they can escalate much they want non conventionally but india will not respond conventionally for fear nuclear escalation the nuclear umbrella well this action just proved india doesnt give shit about the pakistani nukes and will not hesitate use its conventional superiority how many terrorists died immaterial that iaf was used instead special forces and that not just the loc but the actual border into pakistan was crossed the big news,1
pak says the iaf violated the airspace and got inside around kms and when paki jets were scrambled they made retreat and dropping payload external fuel tank retreat faster how true you think this statement theirs,1
admitting the body count pak will confirm them terrorist state note iaf had have very reliable intelligence and very strong reason fly into pak territory execute this one admitting body count not the favor pak they will with breach air space and dropping payload forest,1

both sides are getting bogged down jingoism and unnecessary details the bottom line remains that iaf could successfully breach the pakistani air space and return unscathed that itself big news india ups the ante with this move and pakistan left defend undefendable position,0
just coming here after seeing some videos whatsapp thanks for blowing them hell,1

majority indian muslims oppose ucc want sharia law support triple talaq instead embracing south asian cultures they want become arabs deny hindu holocaust massacres they care more about some palestinians middle east than kashmiri pandits worship anti hindu despots like mughuls and turkish taimur badmouth hindu culture hindu civilization and pro hindu parties when majority places like and kerala they are intolerant hindus and attack hindu processions vote for pro minority socialist govts which prioritize religious appeasement over development jpg,1
few bad people does bad thing entire community suffers the consequences humans are well known stereotype people and categorize people their minds based what they think those category people doesn have right all yet people are stupid enough that for example many people categorize women into separate category and stereotype them into thinking women should only this are expected xyz thing another example men must not cry now those were categorization based gender now there are categorization based all types things from skin color religion country wealth education job caste etc many people darker skin color still face discrimination lot countries example job based discrimination many people consider babas scamsters because several high profile babas getting into scandals that doesn mean there aren good babas out there doing real good work then criticize politicians singular category ohh politician must corrupt then criticize successful industrialists what jerk for having much wealth must have got cheating people all these categorization are bad and should not exist the ideal world but they people are stupid they make these things their mind you fall into any these categories then you suffer the consequences what other people with similar categories have done case muslims and hindus divide all started during the partition and the struggle after that millions people died people who survived will tell their children stories how evil that muslim hindu was who killed your grandpa this make the kids have distorted view the world where person that religion default huge boogeyman and due lack consistent interaction childhood the child grows with those thoughts his mind then each event which come across will categorize his mind ohh that person that religion did this this increases into hatred these issues get amplified someone that category does something really really bad which gets lot media attention this how feminists word for people advocating for equality gender suddenly started looking like negative word because actions few people who claimed feminist was bad that now people think all feminists are bad case muslims the current running stereotype around the world the association lot terrorist organizations with islam this makes people put people associate that with the stereotype sure there are terrorist organizations who are from other religions well but that not the point here people will see the attack and see the religion and just assume both are correlated together next time they come across someone who has those religion they becomes slightly suspicious the online world especially reddit where everyone anonymous these kinda suspicions get openly discussed and people become complete racists sexists and all other kind bad things have lot friends who are various religions including yours don care about religion care about what kinda person you are guess being someone from kerala also have something with this here did not have much inter religion struggle like what northern india had face during partition this means that people here generally not care about religion this means childhood where you get interact with people all backgrounds and thus such kinda hatred not there,0

every individual different but when lot ppl behave certain way generalisation happens known fact that whichever part india has seen rise muslim population has seen unrest and prosecution hindus have even lost large swaths land hindu temples destroyed all over their culture wiped from places like pak and afg and inspite all this they are still blamed for every fuckin incident smuggles steal their cattle police doesnt help but they catch smugglers media says poor minority are being lynched can and but get the gist,1
must say ashamed what abp news doing who their right mind labels their show war room when there war going,1
correct wrong have hard time finding summary all the events but this what collect from various sources pulnawa attack entered pakistan and dropped bombs with news channels claiming killed 300 militias lots proof entering and dropping bombs payload but proof killing militias other than that video where they were not allowing locals the top mountain pakistan started retaliating with cross border firing and penetrating our airspace imran khan admitted this his recent video somehow two our mig planes were their territory and were shot down commander abhi was captured and imran khan released statement all this has happened and modi yet speak right edited add some facts,0
feel for you bro not muslim but upset that indians are turning against their own brethren quickly you seem like very sensible guy and obviously you want what best for india unfortunately are still very divided also pro modi but that does not make anti muslim muslims india are just important hindus sikhs etc,1
online people would prefer low resolution version you your stereotype that stereotype very similar pakistani muslim name the resolution increased one may not have problem with you all but online space doesn allow for that don take seriously you are indian muslim you cannot even survive without hindu serving you one the other way same true for hindus they are being served indian muslims some way the other just take little lightly baggage past you might have assert you indian identity more than hindus but you can take rightly you can always proudly rather than annoyance your grandfather made prudent decision proud always remember that you are not just citizen this country but son this soil that relation you are brother,1
you don have prove anyone you are indian first and will reflect your actions too just like this very genuine rant opinion most people get angry when they see something anti india and because many pakistanis lurk indian pages and they are muslims people quickly jump into conclusion but you might have noticed that anyone with muslim name comments something like pkmkb they get the highest likes and love from the same set you will also see indians supporting afganis and vice versa might turn into religios fight but deep down not,1
indian hindu love indian muslims but healing the mutual hatred certain percentage the population will take time should more united,1
funny thing actually muslim friends are all fine but hate all muslims appears like like muslims humans but hate muslims religion only were not divided religion basis,0
have problem with muslims but deeply repulsed extreme islam wherever islam went destroyed local religions culture way life forefathers fought islamic invaders for hundred years and pakistan founded the same vicious ideology understand that indian muslims are tricky situation they have prove their patriotism every time there situation with pak want them develop have family planing and achieve much other indians,0
read entire comment before reacting now you may personally uninvolved all this but can you understand where the distrust comes from their the muslims loyalty seems primarily pakistan this crime unpardonable general cariappa wrote this here the full article muslims voted for muslim league favour partition but when they got pakistan bangladesh east pakistan after tearing india they refused the land they wanted for themselves and now muslims chose stay india paraded they did india some favour staying read about direct action day muslims murdered and raped hindus sikhs the thousands the night october when the pakistani qabalis attacked kashmir the muslim soldiers the 4jak battalion the indian army killed hindu sikh soldiers their brothers arms commanding officers and joined the pakistani side this why brigadier rajinder singh had only 150 men hold uri against 8000 feat for which was awarded the first maha veer chakra the killings exodus kashmiri hindus the horrific story from ajmer sure you must aware the chisti family for years raped hindu girls hundreds hindu girls and hindu girls only visit any area that dominated muslim population they are ghettos where hindus are harrassed regularly and forced leave kairana much west bengal and many many more every day five times day hindus tolerate hate speech the name azaan loudspeakers that allah which hindus don believe the only god that mohamad his prophet that idol worship sin the very existence hindus sin muslim friend islamic teachings are anti idolators anti kaafirs like hindu quran calls for murder such kaafirs even muslims who don advocate killings believe that idol worship kufr and hindus are doomed because their shikr forget ram mandir ayodhya kashi vishwanath demolition and building gyanvaapi upon forget mathura and thousands those temples across india that have been demolished and over them mosques have been built show kaafirs their place even temples that are functioning are under attack regularly muslims regularly desecrate temples break the idols throw meat many time cows the temple premises muslims regularly indulge cow smuggling and cow murder just recently muslims killed man named ramalingam kerala because opposed religious conversion auraiya seven sadhus were tortured and murdered and their tongue cut off muslims because they opposed cow killing and further back history things are much much more brutal tipu sultan unleashed genocides hindus instance killed lakhs hindus diwali and bragged about this the nizam hyderabad another islamist till this day iyengars karnataka not celebrate diwali for this reason babur was particularly fond raising pillars heads kaafirs aurangzeb was also particularly brutal burying people alive walls sawing them half boiling them oil they refused convert other muslim kings whether akbar shah jahan any other nawabs nizams were also extremely brutal many genocides hindus happened throughout india the indian subcontinent who responsible for all this not muslims and the ideology islam yes there are individual muslims who are well natured good people but the root the ideology from which the mistrust grows islam most muslims not want islam change they refuse accept that there anything problems about and therein lies the problem for the muslim community introspect why they are hated not just india but around the world the europe china russia,1

nasty situation modi was going for show strength but the most realistic accounting seems show pakistan top the moment the only provable real damage far downed indian fighter and captured pilot the downed helicopter with seven dead also bad look whether not was downed pakistan and there also the question why mig was involved dog fight with f16 j17 rather than one india more modern air superiority fighters india comes out this looking impotent they don land few decent shots and that puts modi under intense pressure escalate,1

his disciples opposing the integration islamic culture the indian cultural
mainstream and urging the muslim community keep aloof from non muslims and even
non sunnis adopted traditional well rigidly doctrinal approach reforming the
muslim community india hence doing they the one hand failed see the
benefits western education opportunity that hindus were intelligent enough not miss the result which was felt the second half the nineteenth century when muslims found themselves trailing far behind their hindu fellow countrymen source 76iybwaaqbaj pa68 islamic nationalism emerged some areas where muslim communities were subjected foreign rule ved 0ahukewjc3zbasdzgahwnsh0khql6a2iq6aeikdaa onepage islamic 20nationalism 20emerged 20in 20some 20areas 20where 20muslim 20communities 20were 20subjected 20to 20foreign 20rule false like modern

same faith instead the same language ethnicity etc again this regard according andrew heywood nationalism sometimes depicted “essentially psychological

towards muslim nation called “ummah”— stretching from morocco eastwards pakistan and ruled “caliph” “sultan” instead president monarch islamic nationalism emerged some areas where muslim communities were subjected foreign rule case study going evoke movement that sprang the early
eighteenth century that during the early phase british rule the indian
subcontinent where muslim community lived and ruled the country before the british
took over attention will mainly focused shah wali allah dehlavi prominent muslim figure that time who exerted long lasting impact later generations muslim nationalist
leaders south asia
shah wali allah regarded the british presence the subcontinent well what perceived threat posed the dormant hindu majority serious danger his
community saw the political decline muslims the subcontinent prelude total religious disintegration his fears were further accentuated the misunderstanding and some instances ignorance islam his community mainly result centuries long interaction with the hindu community well the recent contact with western
thought
hence shah wali allah was convinced that unless muslims went back their religion order face the challenge hinduism permanent decadence the muslim community india would undoubtedly ensue his opinion muslims india had preserve their
distinct identity being different from the rest the indian communities and particularly
the hindus order muslims should restrict their interaction with the latter else
islamic values would completely obliterated confirmed hafeez malik the below
statement while the hindu culture has always been assimilative and
willing synthesize with other religions islam had face the
problem preserving its distinct identity which closer cultural
relations with the hindu society would progressively erode shah wali allah uttered cry for islam danger the south asian subcontinent and muslim theologian felt duty bound something save his religion and religionists
from further disintegration thus and his followers embarked revivalist and
reformist campaign amongst the muslim community british india that encouraged
communal tendencies and attitudes common muslims only mainly religious thinking
towards that end urged his community return the islamic religion seek
salvation stated that only god can relied and muslims should stick god sacred
book namely the holy quran spear 224 225 fact staunchly believed that the holy quran was the one and only source that
provided guidance the right path well knowledge all humanity and that the real success for muslims the earthly life well after death parenthetically this stance shah walyi allah delhavi and his disciples vis vis non muslims and non sunnis reflects the rigidly sectarian character the approach their
revivalist movement mat ter fact many historians agree the fact that the leader this movement shah walyi allah delhavi was line with his contemporary mohammed
ibn abd wahhab one the most radical islamists who launched similar revivalist
movement the arabian peninsula historically known the wah habist movement the repudiation islamic aspects islam led shah waliy allah delhavi and his followers embark process islamisition the muslim society the indian subcontinent towards this end urged his religionists adhere the cultural values the muslim
world which were accepted and exemplified the prophet mohammed his sunna malik
1980 257 matter fact ing arab origin shah waliy allah delhavi called
upon his community keep aloof from the cultural mainstream the indian subcontinent
and not neglect the customs and mores the early arabs because they were the
immediate followers the prophet mohammed malik 1980 257 moreover for him was necessary that muslims should cease regard themselves part the general indian society and should never forget that they were integral part the
larger muslim world karandi kar 1968 127 this respect upadhyay 2003 quotes
the indian historian istiaq hussain qureshi saying that shah walyi allah delhavi did not want the muslims become part the general milieu the sub continent wanted them keep alive their relation with the rest the muslim world that the spring their inspiration and ideals might ever remain located islam and tradition world commu nity developed physical and geographical contiguity” integral part the people india and think themselves “natural part the muslim world eventually this would the eyes shah wali allah critics prevent the growth any feeling national unity between indian
muslims and the other communities inhabiting the same country india indeed shah wali
allah incurred wave opprobrium and condemnation from many twentieth century indian
scholars and and prominent leaders the indian nationalist movement mainly those who
adopted western nationalism ideology was accused having sowed the seeds disunity among the inhabitants the indian subcontinent which made difficult their
struggle for freedom from the yoke british colonialism
for instance undertone regret banerjee stated that shah wali allah separatist tendency resulted the fact that “although they—indian muslims—were india they would not india” banerjee the meantime upadhyay
confirms this point stating that shah wali allah “emphasis arabization indian islam did not allow the emotional integration indian muslims with the
rest the population this country ” added regressively affecting the muslim
psyche his ideology debarred from forward looking vision” upadhyay 2003 another
article upadhyay declared that “the religio political ideology wali ullah made permanent crack hindu muslim relation this sub continent which undermined the self pride and dignity integrated indian society”
shah wali allah and his like minded muslim fellows were preaching among their community
was nothing more than different form nationalism whereby they aimed the
cultivation feeling belonging larger group people indeed appealing coreligionists join the worldwide muslim community their objective was create rather extend the already existing muslim nation called “ummah” ",1

air strike evidence public domain depends the goi armed forces does claim record they did hit intended targets number stats for now since will pre mature,1
how election rallies etc help modi win election this time mean all logic must and will receive backlash,1
bjp will spin this win but holefully war shit deescalates,1
situation was calm throughout the night from both nations except for army and iaf movement course wonder how things would unfold abhinandan was not their custody,1
gotta admit our govt has been pushed corner now can much but step back now after their peace move any aggressive move our part just going make look bad the world stage,0
stayed all night and all day following this now have stay all night study for exam tomorrow this shit doesn end tomorrow definitely gonna die exhaustion,0
dont know about meraboothsabsemajboot but people will definetly show their boot most majboot thing next elections address the nation when are verge war instead election propaganda,1
this complete radio silence from modi and this government getting worried feels like these people are working retaliation plan scary times,0
quite clear they expected tougher response from pakistan and expected pakistan escalate the situation,0
remember pakistan claimed they did not use any 16s please stop believing things you hear from pakistan their media too and yes our media also sucks,0
many people are posting that why did use mig could have used better jets may have been due end use agreement between the manufacturer other jets and the buyer cum user india the end use agreement defines the rights given the buyer for the usage the weapon weapon buying country breaks those agreements then weapon exporting country can block exports parts and block repairs may even use built hardware trojans rare case but still possibility one reason for using mig maybe that mig has such end use agreements russians gave the full transfer technology and manufacturing rights the 1960s lesson for future improve local manufacturing weapons edit the fact that asked pakistan not use without their permission raises concerns for purchasing foriegn weapons source,1
know that important take things with pinch salt and demand proof but some indians refuse believe the iaf while conveniently trusting the paf and pakistan govt who have been caught lying many times the past and even now don trust the modi govt but have full faith our army navy and air force similarly there were doubts over the surgical strike until the proof was released okay hate the media not trust the govt but don blinded your hate much that you can think straight,1
was this seriously peace gesture golden opportunity for pak like come out the peace preacher gonna become hard convince the world about them supporting terrorism now prevent aggression that they clearly couldn take and what bolster public image,1
while people the media twitter and plethora other social media have been insanely irresponsible with their statements important still see that freedom speech and freedom the press are still very vital democracy calls for banning twitter shutting down media not the right answer,0
apparently satellite images show that the iaf strikes balakot missed the target according images will released tomorrow,1
with all the hubub about the f16s are overlooking something else they entered our airspace with aircrafts and our jets responded them let reiterate that aircraft for context when bombed the jem camp balakot used mirage 2000s this was not just show that they can enter our territory this was clearly strike force while before was not 100 sure that they wanted bomb military installations because that would blatant act war jets definitely for bombing run now according former air chief marshal tipnis who appeared ndtv just few moments ago missed part what said post summary what did hear the iaf representative the was bit muted and didn provide all the evidence because they didn want escalate the situation thats the case don blame them our media channels already declared war yesterday definitely won trust the media handle this appropriate manner said that jets shows that they were clearly bombing run and speculated that they might have been trying take out critical infrastructure like the srinagar airfield said that the iaf intercepted the planes soon they crossed the loc and that the paf wasn expecting this level preparedness and thus turned back hastily still talking ndtv was talking about wing commander abhinandan edit look this comment below,1
guess f16 came back bite their ass they pissed and trump they were given f16 defend and not attack trump has already called their bull shit past guess arm twisted them returned the pilot because other then that don see why the country who was trying use him bargaining chip suddenly turned all santa india has stuck the script that was attack our military installations pakistan can deny that infact they were thumping their chest not all over their air space still closed black out will happening soon and the money they are guzzling will accounted world back for them kudos our government for not giving into shit and releasing statement and taking them back unlike pakistan who are caught with their pants down,0
was criticising the govt and modi earlier for not putting out statement still believe modi should put out statement reassurance but was good that kept mum till now didn make any factually incorrect statements and confirmed the facts before going public,1
guys for one believe the army and iaf not the media the mea army iaf has not once lied the other hand pakistan army and air force have now lied through official means multiple times these couple days,0
you shoot down modern with soviet era mig and later have tea the enemy place pretty badass,1
why the fuck are uncle and aunties still believing crap frm whatsapp messages hindi news channels,0
finally reading all about this ndtv has released the details pakistani jets tried cross over stopped air force fighters 2000703 how iaf mig bisons took f16s abhinandan downed f16 through r73 another f16 hot trail fired one amraam sidewinder missile abhinandan and another one his wingman abhinandan got hit while second amraam failed engage and hit inside indian side loc what remarkable here the failure engage from amraam remember another incident from syria recently where amraam fired from navy f18 failed engage here the account the definitive account the syrian shoot down from the pilots themselves mob pilot nickname locked the from behind with aim sidewinder and fired the missile zipped off the hornet wing rail trailing smoke but quickly disappeared wasn clear why the missile failed track the where had gone mob quickly selected aim 120 amraam and fired once again noted how long took for the missile fire off the super hornet cheek station located along the outer edges its air intakes,0
just heard retd air chief marshal tipnis ndtv wow what insight gave what probably would have happened and what probably paf jets were probably intending,1
takeaway seems that the crisis largely over shall concluded once abhinandan returns indian soil,1
aljazeera and reuters confirmed existence jaish madarsa ran yousuf azhar away from indian airstrikes site which they were denied access pakistan army while imran khan talks peace completely denied even existence such camp might have missed strikes but exists villagers from nearby anonymously confirmed was terrorist camp before being turned into madarsa and still inaccessible villagers while our media pushing for war now was peaceful before airstrikes can really trust pakistan government after all this has come light know war never solution but not sure what now,1
the show aim ram missile remains direct indication that lied through his teeth although understandable because the that gave pakistan gave them with riders and conditions pakistan caught between two stones now,1
june 2018 jud field 200 candidates pakistan general elections 2018 general elections jud deploying 200 candidates 1256169 2018 jud chief hafiz saeed’ son son law contest pak election chief hafiz saeed son son law contest pakistan election little known allah akbar tehreek party registered with the election commission pakistan has fielded 265 candidates including the talha and waleed dawn reported,0
the mea guy coordinating the press conference absolute talent what his name single handedly coordinating everything,1
here take india probably destroyed something importance otherwise pakistan wouldn have cordoned off the area claims ready take media the site but cannot due bad weather also probably missed one two the targets due paf responding and hit whole lot nothing also clear that pakistan has used and remember that their initial claim was indian jets down with pilots arrested india has always maintained two jets were down but only only was indian furthermore they later said only pilots arrested with one the hospital and then changed the story and again and said only one pilot arrested clear two jets have been downed and one pilot definitely has been theirs you might hate modi kaka but indian military personnel has always been credible unlike the pakistani counterparts,0
all are absolutely stupid you think that was nothing here the narrative that pakistan has put out far indian jets entered our territory and got beaten back our jets they dropped payload but missed and there was nothing hit anyways then show that too can infiltrate india sent our jets which none were f16s and dropped minor payloads open spaces and not any military civilian installation then indian jets entered our territory and shot down jet and captured pilot the fact that have recovered weaponry which only used f16s thus shows that the above was lie they lied about not using f16s they lied about the not targeting military installations hitting military installations act war they lied about the number planes they shot down and the number our pilots they captured keep mind the air vice marshal stated that they had evidence for balakot strikes well but the govt decided not release maybe they only killed terrorists and the government wants save face with all the lies that pakistan has said why hard believe that they lied about the other stuff like balakot well wouldn the first time far thought pakistan had the upper hand diplomatically speaking they were ahead goi and already had narrative place narrative which convinced least part lot people here including myself but this changes everything imran khan said that they weren conducting any military operations and wanted peace then why did they send f16s plane they are only supposed use against terrorists against and targeted military installations understand the statements the press conference were bit jarring with all the talk about being ready but the move set wing commander abhi free was clearly not expected anyone thats why they delayed the press conference they also didnt say whether was act war because our country doesn want the first declare war thats where this headed also absolutely believe the avm when said they have more evidence its tactical move not release now case pakistan lies again can use the previous few hours were uneventful but the next few are definitely going interesting the ball pakistan court now lets see what happens edit just clarify not warmongering fearmongering was just stating the facts and explaining why the evidence the iaf provided crucial sincerely hope find peaceful and diplomatic way end this edit some people claiming that the amraam also used the jf17 will have more research and confirm this still doesn change the fact that they targeted military installations,1
think this how things might have gone yesterday paf violates indian airspace iaf intercepts mig shoots f16 and f16 shoots the mig both fall pok pakistan makes the claim that shot down two jets india starts searching for the pilot the f16 and mig villagers seems have seen parachutes however very soon this news was contained suspecting short operation might have taken place bring the pilot back which the reason think there was delay also the pakistan claim two jets true then might have been the reason they went against their word that they had two pilots their custody 16s pakistan can used for offence its against the contract that they have with the also this works perfectly their favour both the jets landed their court they got the advantage the moment the jets crashed there note this just assumption,1
yeddy says aristrike will help bjp win more than seats his state will help bjp win more than seats state yeddyurappa 1944515 html nice,1
indian media praising modi for the release iaf wing commander abhinandan bik gayi hai media putting things simply our media embarrassment utter pile shit,0
pak used f16 weapons meant used fight terrorists and pak uses try and blow indian brigade headquarters wow,1
mamata statement days back sounded utter bullshit when she said bjp are are trying play politics with recent events but after yeddyurappa comments today seemed she was right after all,1
said yesterday and say today this fiasco clearly proves that the word ispr cannot trusted kudos the indian forces for sticking what they claimed since yesterday their credibility cannot doubted,1
the news anchor aaj tak few minutes ago asked one his panelists this move win for india defeat for pakistan like what,1
all those who are claiming that could even jf17 would request you look circumstantial evidence that came today afternoon president knew what had happened and was talking about expecting some good news from ind pak with all the things that had happened can safely conclude that was indeed f16 anyhow now that have claimed f16 let see the denies,1
possible agenda the provide evidence jem camps destroyed and terrorists killed unlikely explain what exactly happened yesterday likely give media tongue lashing for their conduct yes please sing praises modi and his leadership possible tell how prepared the forces are for all out war absolutely demand for immediate release the wcdr likely,0
another thing would like clarify here our government stated that our jets were shot down and that shot down one their jets the pakistani general said the same except didn say anything about paf plane crashing and said that they shot down planes the pakistani general teeeted that one our jets crashed indian kashmir while the other carrying wing commander abhinandan crashed pok there second plane that crashed pok logically has the paf jet could f16 jf17 that our government claims shot down edit made some corrections,0
alright this huge abhinandan released tomorrow,1
nice news pilot released tomorrow apparently torture then too hope,1
all channels already praising modi lul modi speaking live news,1
the first question that our journalist asked them was can take picture before the speech jai,1
you have still not addressed the nation yet after such big conflict and you have gone address multiple political rallies shameful fucking asshole,0
jhakas mind blowing chaiwala had same frustration and created post other subreddit great that this post coming form bakchodi mod please don ban remove this comment already banned from randia nowhere else you don will the biggest viraat bakchod this subreddit,1
agreed too much randi rona,1
bhakt know went around saying modi performing chemo india kill cancer cells will hurt the body but will ultimately heal after demonisation yesterday was saying the same thing about the air strikes the exact same fucking thing,0
btw true that you are all payroll aap,1
what the fuck our government smoking,0
this good enough proof for the f16 makes sense they waited long confirm and bring the wrecked piece delhi,1
that navy aise bulaya btw things will cool down now everyone was smiling and shit there,0
true that f16 costs million,1
can someone please explain whats written the wreckage what does that mean,0
pakistans shot down iaf found pok photos 792855 pakistan was indeed lying when they said they did not use aircraft yesterday also people should not quick judge indian pilot competence,0
oooh what twist very twisty,1
" 120 amraam
see for yourself this particular variant cannot used ",1
think all makes sense now india provided solid proof being used this against the usage policy that were signed pak and before delivery was supposed used only against terrorist but was used against another country military establishments that too not defence this made trump angry since already upset about all the aids and whatnots being given pakistan and hence immense pressure was put pakistan which lead the release iaf pilot also add the diplomatic pressure from other countries well great win for mea india correct wrong,1
for those who support war what your win scenario how long would such war take surely you don expect pakistan just roll over and die and let not forget that they are nuclear capable,1
this chaos has confirmed but one thing that the national media has been almost entirely captured the bjp the fake news and misinformation has reached unprecedented levels feels like the media operating extension the right wing propaganda machine,1
narendra modi the bjp rally india will fight one india will win one booth sabse mazboot narendra modi says india will fight one india will win one 2000563 pfrom home livetv almost declaring war political rally,1
wing commander coming home amazing,1
very far from bhakt and have faith the indian media and hate this indian political establishment that said the indian armed forces have given reason doubt them they say f16 was downed believe them salute their bravery anger with this political establishment does not change through this episode though continue believe that the air strikes reeked bad planning not from the military perspective but from strategy perspective communication geo political etc they should expected pakistan retaliate how did they expect escalate from the step and what was with the terrible and allowing the media run amok with their wild speculation based unnamed sources also continue believe that must escalate immediately have far more lose economically war than pakistan been given opening with the return our pilot this game one manship with pakistan trying prove who right must not lose sight the bigger picture fighting the terrorists,0
really feels great when people know the reality about india and come out the stupid stereotype that they always had thanks for posting this man was definitely worth the read,1
pakistan where india you from abhinandan sorry not supposed tell you this our media from chennai here the address here his wife photo children photo photo with friends colleagues career record email pakistan thank you,0
find funny how finished his address sat down then waited for the speaker start speaking then interrupted him deliver the news that they will realising wing commander abhinandan such small thing for them that completely escaped his mind lmao the theatrics politicians resort for optics certainly not just pakistani thing universal trait all politicians,1
the evidence shown much bigger than the evidence that was not shown because proves two things pakistan initiated war was against military installations and secondly they had indeed f16 which they have denied all along this breaks the contract that they had with when they got the f16 there could several repurcussions for this act pakistan from across the world,1
the flight lieutenant then was the first and only prisoner war the 1999 kargil war nachiketa was captured pakistan may 1999 and was repatriated india june that year while video footage abhinandan being treated well the pakistani army has been doing the rounds social media nachiketa eight day stay pakistani custody was different — filled with severe mental and physical torture was very tough can describe that experience words that time thought maybe death simpler solution but thankful god that destiny was side underwent severe mental and physical torture there for three four days nachiketa told hindustan times during interview 2016 while nachiketa thought that would never return said there comes point where you think ‘death simpler’ but fortunately for the third degree part which the last part didn’ start for pilot abhinandans capture pakistan brings back memories kargil war hero kambampati nachiketa 3591971 html,1
the f16 was actually brought down mig bison then actually huge deal for india and the pilot amazing achievement and hopefully get enough proof and confirmation the dogfight and what happened soon,1
clear evidence that pakistani was involved the aerial battle over naushera the aim 120 can only fired from the,1
weak bait but will bite you have any bit logical reasoning you would able get your answer after yesterday 27th attacks pakistan and the subsequent capture the iaf pilot the entire country hates pakistan and pakistanis you are extremely emotional with deep wounds partition that anger will amplified doesn mean that all pakistanis are bad similarly the terrorists attacking india have been all muslims exception kashmiris celebrating the attack too were muslims there widespread belief about muslims keeping religion before country which particularly irksome for lot people times like this forget that there are millions muslims army and police why would you not able connect the dots with the attack pulwama and the hate against specific religion couple with the very bad wounds partition and perhaps you understand why the muslims are being hated,0
the complete media silence from our government despicable the country going through one its most trying times recent memory but the leaders are dead quiet support assurance show strength other than covert operations foreign leaders have spoken out before our own have pathetic,0
this creepy and from years ago,0
customary disclaimer about how patriotic indian concerned about the state affairs country the recent exchanges between the indian and the pakistani armed forces and how the governments both countries have used certain narratives highly troublesome opinion after the pulwama attack india claimed that iaf attacked jem camp and called preemptive attack simultaneously amit shah going around the country election campaigns and citing revenge and teach lesson his speeches asking for votes these are very contradicting outlooks and while all being lapped engaged and enraged audience puts serious question marks the integrity the current government pakistan the other hand has said suffered damages the iaf attack there are stories air raid site casualties mysterious madrassa 190227183058957 html going around where claimed that the iaf just destroyed some trees since then they have also circulated videos indian pilot captivity and mostly the rhetoric has been how being treated with respect and care now coming what really concerns that the citizens both countries are failing see through the political narratives already embarrassing for india that while delayed accepting any indian pilot being captured there were videos circulating online proving biggest fear right now that more proof comes forward the iaf strike not achieving much further questions are asked will become ego issue for modi inch chest and will see more retaliation and this retaliation mind you will not have much effect the kashmir issue terrorism but will pandering voter base pakistanis the other hand the light these skirmishes have completely forgotten that fairly established fact today that their government and military have created environment where harbouring terrorists and denying the same the norm and the pakistani government and military shifting the spotlight from that onto exchanges with india and how unfair india its assessments writing this post with appeal for citizens both countries see beyond political agendas and realise that war even these skirmishes are very dangerous for two countries which should basically focussing growth want encourage debate how make citizens more aware and how not fall for politically motivated narratives and ofcourse heavily biased media both sides not helping the cause will for sure get some flak for questioning the veracity the iaf attacks the jem camp but find worthy questioning don think today day and age with widespread access internet nothing destroyed camp and almost 300 dead terrorists has leaked onto the internet even pakistan whole country collectively tried hide that news would prove quite difficult but hope most redditers can move beyond that and understand the real concern behind questioning that,1
imran khan release your man indian media \ pakistan forced release our hero \ pakistan forced back off come indian media stay patriotic but don twist when you don need pakistan playing strategic game here doubt their call for peace might genuine even for self preservation but what show more mature face just say our man now going safe and end there why become propaganda pawn willy nilly,1
seems pretty clear intervened and there was severe international pressure would have also had some choice words say pakistan using f16s pakistan also cannot afford ongoing conflicts due their abysmal foreign exchange reserves has played this well for his people indians who believe pakistan genuinely doing this gesture goodwill are either too naive too young remember the numerous times the past pakistan backstabbed india after agreeing talks for modi speculation rife that india will release proofs the air strikes press conference today india managed pull those off successfully with further losses seems the case now major victory for modi proofs are released think may have been outmaneuvered the international stage the capture abhinandan sure greatly complicated india plans however the domestic front not think his reputation will suffer any losses seems the case india mig shot down that may the first instance eastern aircraft shooting down western aircraft since god knows when vietnam incredible and props our pilot who did,1
evidence shows pak lied through their fucking teeth good job iaf for showing proof also warmongering from them,1
fuck arnab has the mental capacity two year old,0
wonder what modi plan best case some sort thought out strategic move escalate just short war put pressure pakistan and deterrent every terrorist attack met with such response the pakistanis might more cautious they were pretty surprised the magnitude our response kargil and didn attemot another major incursion like that never had credible way seriously punishing pakistan for terrorism countries like america can cripple nation with sanctions like with iran course just bomb then mercilessly with drones india obviously can but really pushing them the brink and forcing them mobilze their military puts strain their economy and least has make them sweat worst case idiot who tried stunt for election purposes and now will something stupid save face demonetization fiasco makes think the latter unfortunately,0
what with the negative reactions here yes disappointing that balakot evidence wasnt provided but expected balakot inside pakistan way could have verified everything but just hours ago people here were claiming f16 wasn used this clear proof that has been used far the paf story seemed concrete but now you can see the holes appearing they had lied about the f16s why stretch believe that they lode about balakot and everything else,0
modi still bitching about congress wow,1
indian media gloating over this great supposed victory jem still operates camps pakistan lashkar taiba still there pakistan still supporting militants kashmir nobody has seen any proof what the outcome the balakot air raid actually was meanwhile imran khan now looks like statesman and india jingoistic war craze looks downright insane when take terrorists can with internal politics mind,1
okay end airforce will give evidence,1
amidst all this crux was the terrorist attack indian soil india retaliated terrorist installation view india hitting ghost targets pakistan attacked military installations india agree the ghost targets were inside pakistani area now explain how this peace looks like calculated chess moves both sides for political gains,0
how will the pakistani military respond this aren they eager stand india,0
still bit confused about yesterday faceoff mig21 piloted wing cmd abhinandan shot down and itself was shot down another paf fighter was custody and now will released there were reports another mig21 shot down and another pilot missing action was that legit all any updates this other pilot,0
that good hear honestly seems like peaceful conclusion most likely this scenario because neither side really has much gain and lot lose and the root cause this specific situation terrorist attack that neither state had causal hand seems like once emotions cool that logic will prevail also while important note that pakistan and india have fought several wars before they have not had major conflict since both went nuclear,1
smart move couldn realistically anything with him anyway the perfect insult india shot down your planes and captured your pilot our space have him back and for india they were able strike revenge for the bombing target everyone can claim their masculine victory now and move,1
strikes balakot pakistan iaf army navy joint media address 1st after india pak escalation 2000629 top minister has said that the political leadership will not comment the stand off and this was conscious decision can compromise national security the minister said,1
some more bits his speech front parliament not chronological order how said them the only purpose our strike was demonstrate our capability and will said prime minister imran khan while addressing the house did not want inflict any casualty india wanted act responsible manner khan said tried call indian narendra modi the phone yesterday because escalation not our interests nor india the prime minister reiterates that talks over kashmir are important have feeling that the indian public does not agree with the current government warmongering their media had seen what our media has seen over the past years referring the war terror pakistan has had suffer they would not have created this war hysteria india should ask why kashmiri youth resorted suicide attack says khan khan said that although india had blamed suicide attacks islamic radicalism was common tactic employed hindu fighters belonging the tamil tigers prior they weren doing because their religion suicide attacks are weapon the weak they are done out desperation the said added that india had blamed pakistan for the attack without proof shouldn they asking why year old agreed become human bomb asked referring the video the kashmiri youth who had claimed responsibility for the pulwama attack you cannot send idea jail khan questions indian policy kashmir all this issue because kashmir want ask the indian public about all that has happened over the past years there indigenous movement kashmir one point kashmiri leaders had not wanted separation but because indian brutality today all they demand independence einstien’ theory madness doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different result how long will pakistan blamed for everything kashmir and asked take action without any proof pakistani media was very mature they didn any war mongering but was upsetting see the kind war hysteria created india its media says offered dialogue india but response not good,1

unpopular opinion but sorry pakistan played front foot across the boundary the game nothing with moral and ethics elevates pakistan otherwise poor global standing ultimately india does now have new status quo far targeting terror concerned the mirage strikes cement that while pakistan whiffs away with the game true gesture would arresting and repatriating masood azhar,0
pakistan seems have closed their airspace again what are they upto,0

reminder that the f16 isn super advanced jet either yes newer and more advanced than the mig but the f16 came out the 70s both aircraft have been heavily iterated modified and upgraded over the years the has been trying replace the f16 for while now first they tried with the f22 which turned out too expensive and are now trying with the f35,1
very nice hear the situation escalate this point bith countries seems have achieved their objectives although the relative «winner» would say pakistan the pak army has proved its relevance pak politics and thus budget cuts and security while india showed takes shit the reason why ’ say pakistan «won» gained more prestige that they not only shot down indians planes but also showed responsibility now releasing the pilot while its army showed mercy the video the capturing and rescuing the pilot from angry crowds there slight chance further escalation india but this point seems that the chances gains for india outweighs the risk further escalation and humiliation edit although think india could skillfully keep the situation current levels thus keeping pak airspace closed and therefore loose money,1
things are deescalating right,1
modi doesn seem backing down and instead seems doubling down hope its just tough talk and that they working deescalate the background there war and attack first will one the biggest diplomatic blunders india history,0

stereotypes exist for reason having said that don mistake few thousand people hatred and anger entire community view point hindus whole are very moderate community but events like these happen periodically and source always the same then its not helping the situation then obviously people come out defence saying that one man action should not taken entire community viewpoint everyone knows that but what that community actually doing prevent these one out situations then due these people comments anger fuelled even more you don see hindus blowing out themselves the name religion matter how angry they get,0

anything pakistan that been trying spin this off gesture good will and showing themselves off magnanimous while reality they been forced the international community large comply with the geneva conventions and remember pakistan not exactly state that has good record obeying international norms and moreover they have been reprimanded for aiding and abetting terrorism for furthering their radical agenda something they been doing for over half century now from india perspective everyone has snapping point after suffering several catastrophic events terrorism the recent past such the mumbai attacks uri attacks the recent pulwama attacks and not mention the numerous ceasefire violations firing across the border indian villages and military posts india has been tolerant all this thus far but the recent loss personnel was the snapping point was then when india lost hope that pakistan would ever change its ways and took upon itself weed out the terrorists now its abundantly clear that pakistan trying play the good cop bad cop routine trying portray its civilian leadership righteous generous and peace loving entity while the true puppeteers the military will continue play the same old game aiding terrorism and using them their sidearm,1

all the famous pakistani journos are scrambling delete any tweets referencing the heavily edited propaganda video all the respect had for gone,1
quite surprised that there are large number indians social media who have sung endless praises imran khan over his gesture while thankful for the safe return our brave pilot the fact remains that while many people gush over him none aware the truth and perhaps never will what were the reasons and motives behind imran khan gesture did the india airstrike have role did indian diplomacy help putting international pressure pakistan did the announcement about the media interaction the tri service cheifs play role while modi politics might not everyone cup tea endlessly criticize the government with out facts and merely the basis speculative drivel from indian pakistani other international sources frankly annoying and gives the impression that even supposedly non bhakts and self proclaimed representatives india pakistani reddit are susceptible propaganda hail imran khan the bringer change and call him south asia greatest statesman today premature and idiotic long pakistans armed forces have say everything from the food pakistanis eat the clothes they wear through entities like the fauji foundation and shaheen foundation nothing will change real democracy one that holds armed forces the civilian leash you will,1
some people are sharing that propaganda video abhinandan first interview india,1
its clearly obvious that our wing commander was forced say all those things pak army look like hes looking someone and then looking back camera again like someone behind the camera either holding page pre written speech telling him what say and ofcourse all the cuts possibly because the pak person behind camera saying dont say that say this instead hence million cuts this whole thing done unprofessionally that its not even credible but what else can you expect from pakistan,0

going disagree here not with the part dealing your parents behavior with you but definitely the part where see imran khan and peace the same sentence before labelling bhakt modi fan war mongering hyper nationalist just listen out after that you feel there factual inconsistency there some loophole argument free engage with you and hear you you must first understand that imran khan isn the saint what the world trying make him just because sounds convincing and uses words like peace and logic doesn anyway reflect his stance and policies terrorists pakistan facade long used pakistan and has been there modus operandi project image peaceloving nation and often claiming the victim terrorism imran khan himself has used the army come the power and the pakistani army hands glove with isi helps terrorists they anti terrorists they should thanking for destroying the terrorists even certain sections want praise the indians for this they won because then they have answer the questions following like how long had these terrorists camps had been operating and what are the steps the pakistani govt taking counter such camps far the release indian pilot concerned they had release him because the don have much choice per the protocol and given the present situation and they want projected thr the nice guys when sushma swaraj says was preemptive strike not against any nation but terrorist outfits and return indian defence installations are attacked about which now have evidence the f16 shot down presented during the army press briefing should enough botheration what were pakistani jets trying accomplish not undermine the sovereignty the indian state the indian side says aren targeting the pakistani army and return pakistani air force tries bomb indian defence establishment then who escalating the war this logic they should also attack usa because the americans fucked laden pakistani soil and despite known for harbouring terrorists over decades they still have the fuckin audacity talk about peace peace isn not retaliating and protecting people peace taking care that insidious activities take place your sovereign territory and looking that those who disturb peace are brought justice really embrace imran khan can arrest the likes hafiz saeed masood azhar and long list terrorists both recognized the and the the indian agencies but until that day will only hypocrite and nothing else tommorow know that stern action taken against such people might even nominate him for the peace prize but should prove that has the balls and even after all these facts you trying say the indian side that wants war then that equivalent victim shaming the rest leave your fine sense judgement but please learn read between the lines the world would have been lot better place people were actually what they portray cms asia 44965868,1
yes you are right they are not entirely wrong either pakistan two faced policies have always brought terror attacks india once the peace dialogue starts some terror attack happens india india provides evidence pak pak denies peace dialogues start again and repeat for decades sure there hate between the people either countries course there are exceptions both sides but yes most the citizens are frustrated because the continuous terror attacks and pakistan blatantly lies told her that all this hate was really negative pakistan had been victim terrorism too etc not hate per actually reaction response the current situation you are more mature than them this regard but you have remember they grew different times and they know pak has been victim terrorism too whole india stands them when any attack happens there the problem they have with pak policies and inaction towards terror breeding their nation hope you understand bit tolerant them just like india has been with pak don you think,0
